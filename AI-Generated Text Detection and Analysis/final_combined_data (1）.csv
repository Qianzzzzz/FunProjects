"Imagine turning on your computer and reading something negitive that makes you sad then your computer changes the screen. The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a good thing. This makes learning easier for students and helps them comperhend better. There's 1 main reason why and that's because it helps you learn.

For students learning somehting new is always hard, but it's more hard when you dont have a teacher around to explain it for you. The article states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This basically shows you that whenever your not for sure about something changes will be made to help you understand what your better.

In conclusion my 1 main reason why is because it helps you learn. With teachers not being able to answer your question outside of school, having a computer that can help you based on you facial expression would benefit alot. Anyone can say they've learned somehting but your look says it all.",0
"Walking into the voting booth ""...every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November"" Office Of Federal Register 6, the people of the United States of America expect their vote to count. Although, the president is elected in a more indirect way, by the electoral college, which does not represent the people, and is not fair. The president should be elected by popular vote from now on.

The first problem that the electoral college faces is the fact that it does not truly represent the opinion of the people. First, voters can walk into the booth and ""...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" Plumer 10. Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost deceitfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments noticePlumer 10. Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is ""rare""however, it has happened before in 1960 Plumer 11, and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and GorePosner 16.All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.

Looking deeper into the subject, elections by the electoral college are not fair. The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""Office of Federal Register 7. Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votesPlumer 13. This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538 is an even number.."" Posner 18. Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors. Another issue with a tie in the electoral college lies in how that draw is resolved. The tiebreaker is left to the representatives in congress, and ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming...would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California..."" Plumer 12. This simply does not give all the voters equal say in who wins the election. All of these topics and more compressed together represent how un fair the election truly is.

Entering the booth next election day, dont only think about who you are voting for, but also how you are voting for them. It makes all the difference, and, ultimately, the popular way is the best way.",0
"""THE IDEA"" Venus

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it Presents.

Venus is our next Planet howerer it has prove a very challenge place to examine more closely. The author supports this idea by all of the information given in the article. Everytings the author saying in The Challenge of Exploring Venus are not easy but they are survivable for humans.

venus is a planet it's pretty close to Earth and Humans want to study about it, to know stuff about it but at the same time is a danger but people can't let's the danger stop them. Like NASA did she's working on other approaches to studying Venus, we knows that is a danger but don't forget the danger can change into a good thing, imagine how beautiful it is for people living in venus.

The idea of sending humans to study Venus is not a bad idea but is a very challenging idea.

The author did a pretty good job in the article, i am really enjoy it.",0
"Body actions say more than words could ever say. This can simply be tested by taking a glance at any individual you may come in-contact with; almost immediately, our brains can process exactly how the other person is feeling. In recent years, this process we do ourselves, has turned to technology. Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckam Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has worked close by Professor Nicu Seb from the University of Amsterdam, to accomplish creating a computer program that can capture and explain human emotions. After some time, this work in progress became a reality, and was named the Facial Action Coding System. This invention has sparked interest in many different groups of people and in many varying fields of work. One of these fields is education. The Facial Action Coding System can positvely be used in the classroom to improve overall student experience by effectively and accurately catching a glimpse of their nonverbal communication in hopes to result in lesson plan alterations and opening prime opportunities for vulnerability in teacher to student relationships.

This new technology advancement has been found to provide very accurate results based on anatomy; therefore, would be sucessful no matter where it was used. Creator, Dr. Huang, definitely did his research when creating the Facial Action Coding System. The text reads, ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to convery specific emotions."" Based on this information, it is easy to see that our body language, and simple expressions are simply coded in our human anatomy; Da Vinci knew it and now so do many others. All of the human muscles work together to deliver our innermost feelings and thoughts. The text reads, Eckman has classified six basic emotions -- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness -- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This information is essentially the way in which the Facial Action Coding System calculates human emotions in hopes to cause other people to potentially act differently. All humans use the same facial muscles, so this product can be effective on anyone.

Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This piece of text is important to comprehend in order to fully understand the capabilities of the Facial Action Coding System. By using this structured and prepared system the results relayed back to an individual are extremely accurate. As a result of this accuracy, not only could the product be used anywhere; one of the most effective uses would lie in the classroom. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System uses a sytematic process to determine any individual across the world's emotions; which is an important piece of evidence because many individuals may not believe its' accuracy.

The Facial Action Coding System can effectively used in the classroom to adjust lesson plans based on student preference. One aspect, Dr. Huang mentions is the prevelance of nonverbal communication; especially for young children who are in the education system. He says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, includimg emotional communication."" This quote is significant when in the context of the Facial Action Coding System. Within the walls of a classroom this computer program could be used to dig deeper into a students emotions and feelings in order to understand them better and adjust to specific needs. For example, after using this program on a group of kids in the classroom; red flags may appear that gear toward frustration, stress, or confusion and this would give way for a teacher to step in and make a difference. If a large group of students were confused, the teacher would then know they may need to review the topic more thouroughly or by taking an alternate approach. If the computer system can reveal that a student is frustrated, the teacher would be able to console them positively in hopes they would be willing to take part in extra help or practice wihtin a subject. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored."" As previously mentioned, by using the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher will be informed of the emotions and feelings of their students that they are unwilling to first hand share with an adult. Overall, this computer program would offer many positive advancements to the classroom that help teachers better prepare for individual student needs and preferences.

As the Facial Action Coding System could contribute to a teacher's knowledge of student reaction in the classroom, it could also make the classroom a much happier place by opening up chances for vulnerability and positive emotions. As previously stated, as a teacher becomes more aware of his or her students' emotions and takes practical steps towards fulfilling their individual needs; a door to vulnerability is quickly opened. Within the walls of a classroom, the relationship between a teacher and student is very important and can make or break a students learning for a short span of time. If the Facial Action Coding System was able to spot a negative emotion, and enable the teacher to step in and help the student walk through that struggle; vulnerability happens in the classroom and can make it a much better place to be. In additon the text reads, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" As the FACS enters into classroom usage, many students will become more aware of emotions they may be unable to verbalize. With this knowledge they may be able to better combat their negative body language and work on recognizing when their emotions may be going down a wrong path and be able to change it quickly. Just as that quote said, making a specific emotion may allow the individual to rapidly improve. Overall, the usage of FACS in the classroom would allow for students to have much more realistic and intentional relationships with their teachers and improve their emotions everyday.

All in all, the Facial Action Codign System is a computer system created that could have many important usages in the future. However, one of the most essential would be within the walls of a classroom. This opportunity would open many positive chances for emotions to be relayed accurately to a teacher in hopes that they would be able to alter lesson plans and change other aspects of their teaching style to better suit individual student needs. In addition, other studies and research completed with the FACS shows that this system can and will relay accurate results because body language is universal and our human anatomy does not lie. Lastly, allowing students to better understand their emotions will help them react to them before they may get out of hand. With early detection and acknowledgement of negative emotions the classroom could become a much happier place to be. This system is going to change the way many programs work, but mostly within the classroom. Teens emotions are always changing, body actions always say more than words could ever.",0
"Im going to tell about how the author of the article ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is trying to convince people to explore and stuying one of our 8 plants called ""Venus"". He starts off by geeting in detail with describing how vevus is by stating "" Venus sometimes caleed the Evening Star,is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,and saying venus is the second plant fro our sun. Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too. He also discribed the plant as a cloud-draped world, and says maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched downn on venus in more than three decades

The author also gets into some math into this by breaking down some percentages that venus has compared to other plants by saying. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus "". he also says that one the plants surface , temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and theatmosphere pressure is 90 times gretaer than what they have experienced on earth. Venus has the hottest surface tempertature of many plants in our solar system, even with mercury being closer to the sun. He basically telling us about the percentages and the deepest amont of venus and other plants we didnt reaserch about.

In more of the storyhe tells you the things yo are exprcted to see on venus. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. The planet has a surfae of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. He changes the subject and goesminto the NASA and how they have ideas on sending humas to study venus. he describes how going out there would be like by saying imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above theroiling venusian landscape. Also at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tha air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth",0
"Many places around the world have been taking charge and limiting car use to the public. There comes some great advantages when doing this. You can help limit greenhouse gases, relieve the stress from cars, and become less dependent on your car for transportation.

The big advantage about limiting cars is to help prevent the rapid spread of greenhouse gases the creates smog in cities. From source two you learn that cold nights and warm days cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions polluting cities even more. With these dangerous gases in the air, the world is in great danger of becoming unhealthy and we are to blame for this awful cause because of the over use of cars. By limiting the use of cars you limit the amount of pollution in the air.

By limiting car use an finding other means of transportation, you can actually relieve stress put on you from the constant beeping and noises made by cars. By walking or riding a bike you hear the nice peaceful sounds of the great outdoors while knowing you are doing good to you and the environment. Some people, as seen in source three, have taken this experience of the limiting of cars to share the experience with their companion riding a twoseated bike. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" By limiting the use of cars you begin to be less depended on cars. By this happening you learn your life will know longer be circled around your car and you begin to see that driving a car everyday is not really needed. By using public transportation of carpooling you greatly decrease the amount of pollution in the air while also having a ride to work or where ever you need to be.

Limiting cars can have multiple advantages to it. You can help stop half of the greenhouse gases that are caused from cars, relieve stress, and become less dependent for the need a car. This will cause you to become a better citizen and help make the world last longer for hundreds of generations to come.",0
"Phones & Driving

I am going to show my opinion about Texting or being on the phone while driving and, I show some you'll what could happened when you decide to be on the phone while driving. An I hope when you are reading this, I hope you chance your mind about texting while driving and I should thank all my reader for taking the time up to reading this essay.

When you are driving a car you hear a text pop up on your phone and you want to get it so bad and you do but, when you do you stop paying attention to the road for just a minute then a car behind you hunks because you aren't driving right and that make you jump so you start driving right. The driver was just lucky that he just got hunk at or it could've binned much worst like a car accident, and someone could have got hurt. In my opinion people shouldn't not be texting while driving because it only takes a simple mistake, and someone could get hurt. I think that it was a good idea that modern cars develop cars that you can call people and talk to people on the phone while driving plus they have their full attention. When you are texting while driving you looking up and down while driving and I would suggest people should put that do not disturb on your phone or you can put it in the glove department, so you won't be interrupted while driving.

My conclusion to all this is drive safe because I don't want to look on the news and see anybody getting hurt because of you are on your phone. If you don't care do it to save the other people from driving and I see why they are pushing this to be outlaws so there could be less accident on the road. I hope and thank you for reading my essays.",0
"I belive that ths face is a natural landform. I belive this because, on May 24. 2001. on that day go back 25 years. NASA we went around the planet taking pictures. Then we spoted the face! We had to know more, it was two miles end to end. It was Viking 1 that took the first photo of this face, in 1976.

I know this is just a natural landform because, we took a close rlook at this face. We found out that, it was a huge rock formation. Which just seemed to look like a head. then the shadows that makes it seem like there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Which are all caracterstics of human face. The public thought different though. They are the ones who made the mars face so popular. It appered in hollywood films. This face also made apperences in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The public thought it was alien life on mars.

While the public and other scientists thought this face was bona fide evidence on mars. We as in NASA say its just a natural landform. But we do wish there was life on mars.

We still tried to get more and more photos of this face. In Sept. 1997, we thought it was important for tax payers to find out if this was just a natural cause, or life on mars. A couple years later on April 5, 1998. We got another picture of this face, this picture was ten times sharper the the first photo ever taken. Which this photo proved to everyone that. This face is a natural landform, and not an alien monument.

But apperently after taking all this time, not everyone was satsified. The people still belive that, it is alien monument. SInce mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it wa sin winter in april 98. it was a cloudy time on mars. So we ended up doing more recearch on this face. It was April 8, 2001. We made contact with a spceshuttle in space. We aske them to take a picture of the face. Their resposnse was that they do not past the face very offten.

They ended up taking a picture of the face. They had some diffecalties getting the picure. But they took the picture. On that day it was a clear day. So no one can say that it can still be alien life. What the picture actully shows is that the martian equivalent of a buttle or a mesa. You can refur to those as like landforms in the mid west. People say it remids them of the Snake River Plain of Idaho.",0
"As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?

We we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.According to ""In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal. In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that evennumbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.

You might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way"". According to ""Carfree dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution"".

According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.

So I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.",0
"The limitations of human contact due use technology had negative effects in peoples's lives. Imagine how many accidents happen in they week because the use of the technology using programs a lot. Generic_Name was driving and playing his favoitrs games online,and he did not look to the red light. Limitatios with humans can cause many problems in your life. We need to have limit technology use. Technology gave negative effects in time with family, driving while you are testing, and energy electricity.

First of all, families have limitation of time to talk about their problems because they dedicate more time to technony. For example, Generic_Name was a girls in public high school. She was talking with an old man; the man was looking everyday, and she do not figure out because the man told her that he was in another country. Next, she did not talk with the families and she was one more of many young victim of kindnap. Another example, peoples in families use technology inapropiately causing get all on troubles and having less communication between them as human.

Secondly, some people prefer to talk in text message while they are driving. This is cause of many accidents peoples use devices in their car. Sometimes person does not even look who is begin stting next to them. The are some problems as someone told me. Generic_Name was driving with his mother who was in another country: She came to see him, but he did not left the phone alone and look at his back the computer after a two miles, they crash crossing a railroad. Also, we knows the risk of doing it. People think tha using technoly and have less communication with their family anywhere is safe, but they are wrong because one distraction for our limitation with others human can be deadly.

Thirdly, energy is anothers problem because people spend more money. Even know, this increase a lo of accidents because custome's companies just buy lof of thing as computer, cellphone, and toys. The problem is many peoples spend more time plugin in setting beside its divice charger to get some energy in their computer or cellphone. One more example in about this problems Generic_Name was addicted to the computer in his room. He was charging it. He was friendless because of this reason, and Generic_Name did not talk with his family as normally; however, he just say good bye everyday.

In conclusion, Everyone has to stop using technology for unimportant reaso or things. This will be more safe for you and your family. In ddition, limitation of human contact have more consecuences while you are with your family, driving, and spend more enery. It's your time to chane this word. ACT NOW!!! you can chane verything talk to your mother, father, and your whole family and peoples. I change. I am waiting for you because we do not want our future generation get adiction. The government and the whole word need to be safe: lookin around our beautiful natural resources.",0
"Technology to read the emotional expressions of students shouldn't be used because someones facial expressions of students in a classroom well be like there mad but they won't be mad . Sometimes facial expressions are not always right , they can look upset and not be upset at all . Sometimes people just don't wanna smile or show any emotion . Sometimes the ""Facial Action Coding System"" might work but sometimes it might not . Not everyone face say how they really feel . Can't no computer tell you how you feel because a computer is not you and is not in your head . Can't nobody say how the Vinci was feeling at the time of him painting Mona Lisa . A computer is used to look up things , found out information , video chat , email , do homework on but having a computer read the emotinal expressions on a teenagers face is going have the system broke nobody know's how a teenager feels at that time not even the teenager . Teenagers have so many emotions in one second so how can a computer read a students facial expressions .",0
""" A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"". Limiting the use of cars from people is a great thing to consider. Cutting down the use of cars would reduce harmful toxins in the air that hurt our enviroment and help people save money.

Reduceing the car use of people today would help out our enviroment. To illistrate, smog is a seriosu problem, ""cold nights and warm days caused the warm layer of air to trap car emissions""(Duffer, 15). The smog is not good for our enviroment, therefore we should cut down the use of cars to cut down the amouhnt of smog produced. If we maintain our Earth the way it needs to stay healthy then it wouldnt have lots of issues. Keeping up with the no car use ""sociologist believe it will-it will have benifical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment""( Rosenthal ,34). America's second largest cause for emissions is transportation. We should completely stop or dirastically reduce the amount of car use. These new changes will help our enviroment stay clean and save our Earth.

Another example of why we should controll the car use is because it will save people money. Now that ""118 miles of bicycle paths"" (Selsky, 27) have been made people wont have to drive cars. Cars cost a lot more money than a simple bicycle does. You also dont have to maintain a bicycle as much as you do a car.",0
"To Whom it May Concern:

The Electoral College is the cause of many political disagreements and problems whenever mentioned. Although established in the constitution, it is seen as undemocratic by many. The Electoral College takes away the ability of citizens to vote for their president; instead they are voting for Electors, not always loyal to the canidate. As a result, I believe the Electoral College should only be used in instances of a tie between two canidates.

Each presidential canidate has a group of Electors, which will be part of the Electoral College process after the popular vote is taken. The Electoral College proccess consists of the selection of electors, the meeting in which the vote for both President and Vice President occurs, and then the votes are counted by Congress. (Office of the Federal Register)¹ When the popular vote occurs, and the canidates are selected, the votes are tallied, and then the electors of the two canidates attend the meeting, and then the final decision for President is made. This is viewed as undemocratic, because there have been instances where the Electoral College dissagrees with the popular vote. Such as the case of Al Gore in 2000, who won the popular vote, and then lost the Electoral vote and therefore his presidency.(Bradford Plumer)² This caused over 60 percent of voters, to wish for a direct election opposed to the electoral proccess, according to a Gallup poll, also occuring in 2000. (Bradford Plumer)²

Anotherr issue within the electoral college, is the electors themselves. While they may claim to be loyal to their canidate, loyalties can be bribed, changed, or electors may even be replaced with only a certain party (Republican or Democratic). Which occured in Louisiana in 1960. The segregationists almost replaced Democratic electors, with ones who would instead oppose Kennedy, as a sabotage attempt at Kennedy's Presidency.(Bradford Plumer)² There have also been cases in which the loyalty of the elector was switched, and the citizens were seemingly forgotten at the electoral college. While there are over millions of people residing in the United States, there are only 538 Electors, and the fate of our country is put in Electors who can't be trusted.

Over 60 percent of Americans oppose the Electoral college, but there are still some which still believe in the compromise established by our founding fathers. The Electoral College provides a smaller chance of election ties, and an equal vote from each state. While a tie is possible in the popular voting system, it is also possible in the Electoral College, with 538 electors, 269 votes from each side can cause a huge dissagreement within our Legislative System, which could be avoided by using only the popular vote. When politicians and presidential canidates are looking for votes, they most commonly travel to the larger states, because of the larger population. A larger population provides an even larger chance of obtaining voters. But, this leaves the small states with no attention from canidates, and a smaller population weakens the states chance of the canidate they desire. Every vote counts for a canidate,5,559 voters from Ohio, and 3,687 from Hawaii stopped a tie by voting. (Bradford Plumer)² Even the small states contribute in a presidential elections, their votes are just as big as ours, even if their states ae small.

The founding fathers formed the Electoral College as a compromise, and hundreds of years later, I believe it is time for a compromise once again. The popular vote, should become the deciding vote for who is elected as President, Vice President, etc. With this, the chance of a tie comes, so i propose that the Electoral College remain only for the purpose of a tie in the popular vote, or if state legislature has reason to believe this canidate is not the best for America.

"Car usage is a big deal it is killing are planet and are kids before us. We need to cut back on driving everywere, if you live in town then get a bike if all your doing is going to get some milk, or picking up some extra toilet paper. You dont have to drive everywere but if you do have to go long distance then car pull. I believe, this is just a theory but I do believe that this world will die and everything in it will burn to the ground if we dont do soething aout how mch driving we do everywere back and forth.

The first thing is get a bike people dont believe in walking or riding a bike anymore. They think that you can drive everywere but one day nothing will work no cars no planes just your two feet and a bicycle if that. Everything will just be a pile of scum when the apocalyps happens. The only way to delay it woud be to limit the usage of cars and dont drive if you dont have to, and dont drive 3 cars somewere if you can all fit in one. So what im trying to say is stop waisting this world away and go green.

They have cars now a days that will blow your mind they even have eletric powered cars no gases to polute the air. My air your air car companys are being smart and making cars that are fuel eficiount, or they dont run off fuel at all. It sounds good but if you really think about  it it probably uses just the same amount of gases to make these extremely perfected cars. For instance, I was watching a tv show yesterday and this guy was killing people because they was driving a ""gas guzzler"" and he cared so much about his envorment that he  would literaly take there life because that ment so much to him. I would never do this but theres some psychos out there thats for sure.

Last but not least the mass of how much people drive, it is rediculous. People drive just to go get their mail box to get mail, thats sad I dont care who you are thats ridiculous. Also when people go hunt they ride fourwheelers why would they ride a fourwheeler to be with nature thats kind of defieing being with nature. Why would you go out in nature and kill it by rideing your fouwheeler. If this keeps happening the world will be no more. Because all the polution for the exaust from all of the motorized vehicles is slowly but surely killing planet earth.

In contrary to all of this, none of this will ever happen in mine or your life time. Because the earth is a amazing God made thing. And it will last as long as he wants it to. Just like all the American money in God we trust. But im not woried about my generation im woried about thee ones before me. I will be just fine but my kids kids are the ones im worried about. Thank you for your timee.",0
"Dear Senator of Florida,

I believe that we should keep the Electoral college for our compromise between the election of the president. I argue this because with the Electoral College we get to vote for who we believe is gonna help us out during thier years as President not the choice of the president who we might not believe or trust in anymore to vote for us or the other side. So I argue to keep the Electoral College to select our presidemt for the U.S.

The Ellectoral College lets us People who are able to vote vote for who we want. In ""Does the Electoral College Work"" Source 1: What is The Ellectoral College? written by the office of the federal register states that""by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". This displays that we the peoplewho are suppose to be here in The U.S qualified and a citizen are allowed to vote four our people because those are our rights. So Mr. Senator please keep the ellectoral College by helping to keep it for the people of the U.S just like me.

If we are voting for president the majority of thr votes goes to the president who earn it which says that these people of the U.S need the president they voted for which is the president who won. In ""source 3: In defense of the electoral college:five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" it shows in2. Everyones President that"" The ellectoral college requirs a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal"". So it not possible for a president to cheat its what the people choose for them to help them so the president they choose does what the people wanted or needed. Si I argue for you to do mea fovor and vote for the ellectoral College to stay as is.

In ""source 2: The indefensible Electoral College: why even the best laid defenses of the sysem are wrong"" they tell us wee voting for someone we dont want. But that is why you learn about your electors and who they want so you choose the one whon is going for you which is your president. Its as easy as doing a little research to find out who your really electing for as president of the U.S.

I believe that Us americans should keep the Electoral College so we can keep our rights as our nation for the people. That is what we fought for for our freedeom and our rights. So I argue Mr. Senator to favor in keeping the Electoral Collegeso we can get our electedpresidents for majority of people in the U.S. SO lets stay away from the presidents choice because that is not our rights we are the people for the people to vote for who we want as qualified citizens.",0
"Venus is worth studying because when they study it they called it an ""Evening Star"" also a ""twin"" of earth. It's the closest planet to earth, It is the closest in distence as well. Venus also has a 97% carbon diocide blanket, but on the surface its 800 degrees Fahrenheight. Since the conditions of the planet are like that its way to extreme for humans to live there. Venus is also has the hottest suface temperature in our solar system, even thou Mercury is closest to the sun Venus is till hotter. It has eruputing volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequesnt lightning strikes that happen on the surface of the planet. Scientist think that long ago Venus was like Earth, but even now it still has some of the features that Earth has. It has the rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, craters. NASA is working to keep studying Venus. They have done fom silicon carbide tests that are simulations of the chaos of Venus's surface. One of the things is that they are still striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. So if there is a way that they are able to go there and get more samples from Venus, then maybe that might tell the scientist what might have been there before and help them out with the previous clues as what happened. They also didn't think about how fast the computers we have today would be. But they also said that just imagine exposing a cell phone, tablet to acid, or heat compatible of a metling tin, that must be what the heat is like on Venus. And since they can't be on Venus just orbiting or hovering safely they can't get the samples that they want from that distance.",0
"The authour suggests that studying Venus is a worth pursit despite the dangers it presents. Even though its dangeruse the author still thinks its a good idea to go and study Venus.

You can tell the author belives this to be ok evon though its dangerous when he said,"" Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intemidating eneavors."" This means that he knows its dangruse but everyone is curuose about what they will find, even if its dangerous he thinks its worth it. The opertunity to find signs of life or rare metals it would prove tempting for some even if it was dangrouse.

If you continue to read the passage he goes on to talk about how Venus is inhospitable. He then says he still wants to study it by saying, ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus beause it may well once have been the most earth like."" This means they are trying to see if Venus had life just as earth dose now.

In conclusion the author thinks the pros of going to Venus out way the cons. Honestly I think he is right my self we could discover so much if only we knew what secrets Venus holds.",0
"Dear Florida Senator, I am here to tell you about thee electoral collage, and not why we should keep thee horrible theing, but how we can replace it withe sometheing better. The electoral collage has been in use for a very long time, since thee Constitution was finalized, but it should end now. The Electoral Collage is a confusing system theat can easily be manipulated and changed to benefit one political party. As shown in many past elections, it has just become anotheer reason people do not want to vote. Popular vote is easy and simple and it should be used in future elections.

First of all confusion is a huge factor when talking about thee Electoral collage. We as voters do not want all theese processes. We do not want hoops theat we want to jump therough. We are simple people who want a simple process. In thee electoral collage, theere are 538 electors, withe a majority of 270 needed to be voted in as president. Each state gets entitled to two for your senators, and one for each member of thee House of Representatives. This so far is making my head spin. This could be so much simpler if we just used thee poular voting system. In theis system, thee people can directly vote for theier president witheout any huge hassel. This makes it easier and more fair for thee voters. Speaking of fair, lets talk about how Unfair thee Electoral Collage is.

In thee Electoral Collage, theere is no partial winning. It is a winner take all system, withe thee exception of Maine and Nebraska. This makes it very unfair to votes. Swing states add on to theis idea. Swing states are very large states theat have a higher representation in thee Electoral collage. These are also thee main targets of presidential candidates. By getting theese swing states, candidates can gain a lot of votes in one state. This leaves otheer states, such as Ohio and Montana withe little to no interaction from thee presidential candidates. This is not fair. We need thee popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone witheout any shady practices. And theat is thee last topic, thee electors really control thee final outcome.

The final sin of thee electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wetheer a person is voted in or not because of thee electors. They choose who theey represent. If you can not see where theis is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state withe only representatives of one candidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who theey want to vote for. Notheing more, notheing less.

Even theough thee Electoral Collage seems like the root of all evil, theere are a few upsides. First, theere is less likely to have a dispute thean a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how theey should be. They are larger states theat comprise most of thee population and thee country. They should be represented more thean smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, theere are no RunOff elections. This keeps thee process shorter, but not as short as it would be in thee popular vote system.

So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system theat can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific candidate. Altheough thee electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids RunOff elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift thee election from one side to anotheer. Popular vote keeps thee process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree withe me, I want you to look and thee cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in thee Election from now on.",0
"Phone and driving

According to, ""Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts"" show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Teens that are driving can be easily distracted while being on their phone. Cell phones have not been around of a long time but it have become a key part of our lives. Everyone at least use cell phones everyday some are addicted to there but it also can be dangerous when you are using it when you are driving, It can cause the person to get in a car accident or worse. Although being on your phone help you reach your destination but people should not use their phone while driving because it will cause an distraction, it should be prevented, and it puts innocent lives at risk.

Its very important to keep your eyes on the road while driving because it can cause a distraction. According to, ""NHTSA distracted driving"" Distracted driving is any activity that diverts attention from driving, including talking or texting on your phone, eating and drinking, talking to people in your vehicle, fiddling with the stereo, entertainment or navigation system - anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving. Some people get distracted easily when they are on their phone they might take their eyes off the road which can lead to a accident. According to, ""Facts and Statistics: Distracted driving"" Activities that take drivers' attention off the road, including talking or texting on cellphones, eating, talking with passengers, adjusting vehicle controls and other distractions, are a major safety threat. Its very unsafe to text or call because it could but your life at risk. If you get your eye off the road for second it can become hazards or dangerous. It can be very dangerous for teens while using a phone while driving.

When people are on the phone driving is putting yourself and others lives at risk which is very dangerous. According to, ""Texting while driving puts other at risk"" Texting while driving doesn't only put the driver texting at risk, but also everyone else on the road. Its very important to have your eyes on the road and not being on your phone. You can easily get in a car accident or might kill someone while being on your phone. According to, ""The Risks of Texting while Driving"" On average, teens are the most inexperienced drivers out there, and they are also the most addicted to texting. Teens are at a higher risk when operating a car while on the phone. Most teens don't see the danger when it comes to driving while using their phone.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. They are ways to prevent being on your phone so you don't put yourself or other at risk. You should put your phone on do not disturb so that you don't get distracted or to check your phone while driving. According to. ""Ways to Avoid Texting While Driving"" keep your phone out of reach or if it is that urgent to send a message or answer the phone, take a few extra minutes to pull safely off the road and then text or answer the phone. Everyone life matter not your phone because you don't need to put your life or others at risk because you are texting. Your phone is not important than your life so don't be on your phone while operating a car. According to, ""34 Texting and Driving Statistics That Will Make You Put Your Phone Down"" Commit to driving safe, your text messages are important, but getting to your destination safely is even more important. Everyone should be safe when they are driving and laws are are being made to try to prevent this.

In conclusion, nobody should not use their phone while driving because people on the road are at a risk. Everyone safety should be first not their phones. Drivers can get injured and it puts innocent people life at risk and could lose their life or can be crippled because a person was texting and driving at the same time. Texting and driving need to come to a stop so teens and adults don't die and not only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself it can cause serious damage to the driver and the passengers and the people surrounding you. Driver should know the position they putting themselves and others and they should never have their attention on their phone. They should keep their eyes on the road.",0
"Why are multiple opinions good? It's better than one opinion because some times they could be bias. Opinions could make people better as a person too and it can improve anyone as a person. Also opinions from other people can prevent other people from doing bad.

When you seek multiple opinions you have different perspectives of other people and that could help you make better choices instead of doing whats wrong. Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because sometimes your opinions can prevent bad things from happening like doing drugs or any other substances. Also if someone asks like if they should start working out and stop sitting at home playing games,the better choice would be yes and thats what they would choose because their friends persuaded them that its the better choice.

Another reason why its better to seek multiple opinions can help someone is because it could make their future better,like if they two choices in going to college or not going to college your friends would obviously say go to college. Also when multiple people say to go to college that would change their decision because they realize it isnt a good choice. Many of those opinions will make them rethink about it because it isnt just one person saying it,its multiple people saying the same answer. So the person would have to make a different choice and go to college.

Sometimes they need to ask many other people because they're indecisive and sometimes they would choose to do something that isnt good or the best choice. Whether its multiple people or just two people, that could change them and help make the better choice. Also when someone asks for multiple opinions sometimes they would see how many people would choose the better choice and they would choose depending on majority,most people would choose the better choice.

In conclusion I think everyone should make good choices everyday and sometimes you need opinions to help you decide but you have to remember that sometimes your friends could be bias. However sometimes people opinions can be useful and they can improve your choices. Also when a bunch of your friends tells you to choose the better choice it makes you realize that you did not think about it and you need to change what you chose or choose.",0
"Electoral college is a dictator, boss, or lottery! It's unfair. It is the duty and privledge of the people to select our government leader. We should choose based on our point of view. The second source conveys effective points to consider, such as, directly voting for the president and the disaster factor. It also informs us that, even though unlikely, there is possibility of a tie.

Directly voting for a president is an issue addressed in both source 2 and 3. They agree that technically, we're not really voting for a president. The second source tells us that when we vote, it is actually sent to the state elector, and it is they (electors) who vote for the president. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer voting directly over our system now. Even though source 3 gives us reasons to keep the electoral college, it will support us when we say we aren't actually voting for the president directly.

Source 2 gives us the ""single best argument"" against the elector college as what it refers to as the disaster factor. It uses the fiasco of 2000, the biggest election crisis in a century, as an example of why we are so lucky. The state legislatures were technically responsible for picking elctors and they didn't always have to listen or acknowledge the people's opinion/vote. It takes us further back by giving an example of segregationists back in 1960 where John F. Kennedy almost lost the popular vote of Louisiana when their legislature replaced Democratic electors with new ones that opposed him (Kennedy). What source 2 calls ""faithless"" electors, electors who dont believe that their candidate will win; hence faithless, have occasionly voted in favor of their choice, disregarding the decision of the people.

The third source gives us five reasons in favor of the electoral college method. Even though we don't directly vote, the party chooses the elctors and trust that they will select the voted nominee, and it ensures us that the trust is almost never decieved. Disputes over the outcome because of an Electoral College Vote is possible, but not as likely as the popular vote. The next reason given informs us that a region doesnt have enough electoral votes to win the election for the president they favor. ""Swing States"" is another reason. It refers to states that can be persuaded and aren't neccesarily entitled to a particular candidate, so they will really pay attention to what the cadidates have to say, their campaign. ""Big states"" is the fourth reason and is focused on population advatages. Meaning, a state with smaller population will have just as much impact on the election as one with a larger population, its equal. It is not neccessarily a good thing when the last reason says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elctions in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"". Wouldn't that raise the risk of a tie? Though, it is extremely unlikely that a single vote may decide the president and voters in these elections want to express their opinion and prefernece.

I am in favor of abolishment of the unfair, old-fashioned, and irrational electoral college method. Plus, reasons to keep this system arent as strong and factual as the reasons to abolish it.",0
"The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because ""Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidation endeavor.""

"To start off with, electing electors sounds a little bit redundant. Also, why do we vote for somebody that can vote in their own right as mentioned in article two provided to me? I say as a citizen of the United States that we should vote directly to determine the new president.

If we vote for a representative of our state to elect our president, how can we be certain that he/she will vote as planned? The entire system is far from perfection, but can be fixed temporally. By changing the amount of votes to numbers that be added to equal the amount of representatives respectivly, it can provide an estamation of how many representatives from a state can elect a certain party. For example, if 4,000,000 people vote for republican and 16,000,000 vote democrat in a state with 10 representatives, 2 representatives will vote republican, 8 will vote democrat.

However, if you do this, there will still be flaws in the system. The best way in my opinion of electing a presedent is to go ahead and let the people vote their opinion. Simple calculations to find percentages can determine the majority vote and elect the president/vice president, making things alot cheaper and more efficient. All by using a simple four-function calculator.

To wrap things up, I will state that even though I am only part of the minority of the U.S., I am still a citizen stating his/her opinion towards a better future towards my homeland. Let's put the power back into the people, that way everybody's opinion, no matter rank, wealth, age, can/will count towards our next election in 2016.",0
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that the idea of studing Venus is a worthy persuit, even despite the dangers we may face. The author of this article, however, did not support their claims efficiently enough for others to also support that idea. I know that based on the lack of detail, value, and the previous issues we have face while studing this planet, all prove the authors lack of effectivness aswell.

The author of this article gives us many facts about the planet itself, but not why it would be a worthy persuit to travel there. An example of how the author does this multiple times is how in the concluding paragraph they do not give the examples of our benefits in the exploration of Venus. The author informs us that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". The authors reasoning alone show no real support to the idea of why its worthy.

The lack of value and reasoning show that the trip would be a waste of time. The authors' thought on value is that there is insight there to be gained, but did not provide evidence to what that insight may be. The author also said it will lead us to ""equally intimidating endevors"" but that is likley not the fact, these will just take many of our resources and give us no real benefit for our future.

The many previous issues that we have faced while researching this planet prove no point in why we should go there. The author stated that ""the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". With that information there would be no way for it to be an ""option for a planetary visit"".

To conclude, based on the lack of detail, value, and the previous issues we have faced while studing this planet, we all can prove the authors lack of effectivness aswell. After seeing all the facts and how there was no evidence for why we should continue to explore other than ""imagination"", I do not belive that the author supports their claim of persuit, at all.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number problems that come along with trying to get information on the our planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its close proximity to us. Despite the author describing all of the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all of the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the universe around us, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extrodinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme phyisical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible progess being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenerio, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to acheieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us.",0
"Have you ever wondered how people were feeling emotionally? ""Profesor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Profesor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam"" (paragraph 1). These two scientists are working on a software that can recognize emotions. This software could change the world in many ways.

This interesting software could help create better ways for humans and computers to communicate with one another. In the article it states, ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"" (paragraph 2). I believe that this technology will improve the world. There are thousands of murderers and testifiers that take tests to see if they are lying. With this emotion senser software they will be able to calculate more accurately. When the bad guys are behind bars the people are safest.

The design of this software will be like nothing seen before. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model move like human muscles"" (paragraph 3). This quote may sound really desturbing, but it will change the world. There are millions of hackers world wide and the question is does this make our identify safe or are we at more risk? In most cases you have to give a little to get a little. Yes there are terrible things that could go wrong with this software, but I believe it's for the greater good.

Even without this software today we can still tell how the people around us are feeling but looking at their facial expressions. ""In fact, we humans preform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply by the look on her face"" (paragraph 5). I value this techology for all the good it will do in order to get the bad people away from the good.

After reading this very interesting article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I stand to value this software for the future. There are so many wonderful things this software will be able to. Either by helping with murder cases or just knowing how someone is feeling. It is so amazing that these scientists are coming up with this fantastic software. I can not wait to see what they have in store for the world itself.",0
"The electoral college is not a good thing and it certainly messes things up it takes votes away from people, It changes the votes to make a person lose presidency even by changing the senators, and it's a winner take all system these dont turn out good no matter what. It's even overthrowing the people with the popular vote yes it sadly is possible.

Why would you still have the electoral college if it doesnt help anyone at all?

There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote. The odds of one side winning is easily changed with electoral votes. This interrupts the odds of how much the people likes them then it turns into how much the government of states likes them. However it could help some people win if they are not the popular vote.

It can also make anyone with the popular vote lose when they should have won like after Al Gore during the gallop poll thanks to the perks of the electoral college won the popular vote but he lost presidency over it. Even though 60% of people prefer the direct election now some prefer the electoral college.

But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it. A good argument was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says ""in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would oppose John F. kennedy"" that is just evil. Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made.

Even at the most basic level the electoral college is still unfair to voters because of the winner take all system put in place for each state. They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says ""Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races"" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate exept for Maine and Nebraska it is being used for what they are using it for.

In all the electoral system is not good but its not all bad it takes the votes away from the people,Its a winner take all system, and its taking people down who deserve to win even changing the senators to make them win. Its evil and makes no sense to what they are doing trying to give other parties a chance i get it but its gone a little to far.",0
"People chattering as they walk down the payment, buzzing conversation on who will win the coming election. Large bulleton board's towlering above the city streets and towns a smiling face firmly drawn on them with the caption, ""Vote for me for President."" Television's fills with compains and speeches.  How is it we come to the conclusion of voting a president? and which way do I favor? Among our rapidly growing population and country every 4 year's ""we the people "" cast in our vote for president and who might I ask count those votes? The electoral college, which some think it's a place but acually it's a long process to chosing our next president. The electoral college consists of electors, there meeting is where they voe for he president and also vice president by counting the electoral votes by congress. When you vote for president you are really choosing your candidate and actually voting for your candidate's electors. I strongly disagree with this mythed because I favor more that the president chose be chosen by popular vote  not by electors we chose.

What's wrong with the electoral colledge? You run into multiple issues with the electoral college as you slowly go into it's process and how the president is chosen. One big issuse is the Disaster factor. Considering that state legislatures are technially responsiable for picking electors. If we chose the president by popular vote like we should, it would be more resonable because it's a way so that the people of our country are happy. The eclectoral college is unfair to voter's also.  With the ""Winner takes all"", system is each state candidates don't even spend time in states they know have no chance is winning, there only focus is on the swing states and the ones who have a more lickly chance of winner with there voter! This is highly unfair to the people! Our votes should count more then what electors chose. This is our nation, our country, our home and we should get to decide on who will lead it in a fair way, electors should count all the votes and then chose  the president by popularity and better man.

The elector collegde is said to be a non-democratic method to be overruled by declaring the most popular votes for the candiate the winner. When your voting you acually voting for the slate of electors who will chose the president and vice president.

Chosing our president should be up to popular vote, electing electors who will chose the president is a unfair priocess and the electoral college is very out dated and it's system and ways should be over thought about. Counting our votes on president and chosing the president by popluar vote is the best way to go. Firstly it allows for the president most wanted to become president. Second it's a easier process then having to vote for a elector, wait for there votes, and then wait for there decesion on president. Think about it? We the people, should chose our president souly on poplation votes.

To conclude, the electoral college is a unfair, outdated, and irrational way to chose our presendent. We the people should be able to chose the present by poplar vote not only because it's our chose on who should lead are country but also it's a easier and better way to chose our president. I highly agree that we should be able to chose our next president by poplar vote and rething the electoral college.",0
"Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.

Strangley, the author of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was ""a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,"" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.

Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?

All in all, there is no ""true"" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what ""face"" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.

On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was. For instance, in the text the author stated, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West,"" and, "" Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" With all this said, the Face could have a slight chance of being real life; however, it is highly unlikely that it is true life on another planet.

Ultimately, the Face shown on Mars is just a nautral landform. The Face cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence. All in all, life is changing all around us. New technoloy is being formed, but with a new generation who is ready to show the world what really is in the solar system. The future is in your hands. Find out what is next. Make your mark on the world.",0
"The argument that the face is a natural landfrom is true because there is evedince in the passage backing up my fact.

First he took three pictures one in 1976,1998 and 2001 in 1976 they didnt have good camera he just showed the outline of the butte or mesa landform. In 1998 it was in the winter for the planet was so it change the outlook on the butte. 2001 was the best by far it was during the summer and it was the most recent one taken

Second in 1976 the camera was even close as it is now.

In 1998 the camera made a big step and made the image have the best resolution having a stuning 1.56 meter compared to the 43 meters in 1976 they only problem it was in winter and it was really hazy. So in 2001 they took another image it was not even close to ether of the photos in 1976 or 1998

It made it look like it was a face but thank to better cameras we can see that it is not a face it was just a butte.",0
"In Making Mona Lisa Smile, there are really great points toward technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. In the first paragraph it talks about the start of the computer program. In the last sentence of paragraph 1, it states ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comminicate."" In this case the communication is showing the computer how you feel and the computer doing something to change.

This new technology of being able to tell how you are feeling on the computer is called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). There are 6 classified emtions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear and sadness- and you can tell all of this with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. There are different facial expressions that you can tell if a smile is fake or not. In your real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at cheek bone) lift the corners of your mouth. The other muscles is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus and that makes the corw's- feet around your eyes. If it is a fake smile, the mouth is streched out sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. You can easily tell how anyone is feeling just by looking at their facial expressions.

I believe that you could use FACS to help with a lot of things. For examples, when a kid is broed at shcool or they are falling asleep in class, the computer will sence that and change up what is going on to the computer to make them stay focused or interseted longer. You can simply tell how one of your friends are feeling just by the look on their face or their facial expressions and sometimes you don't really know whats wrong you can just feel it. Now that they have came up with FACS you don't really have to worry about the expressions because sooner or later it will come out of them about what is wrong.",0
"Should or should not drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Some people strongly feel that under no circumstances should a person be allowed to use their phone, and there are others who feel there is nothing wrong with using your phone in your vehicle if it is used responsibly. I strongly agree that drivers shouldn't be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

I can honestly say that I have seen multiple people get in real bad car accidents while looking at their phone. Even my own sister got into an accident because she wouldn't stay off her phone. I think banning cell phone usage in a car while driving is good. Having cell phones while driving isn't safe for others or yourself while driving. It can cause accidents, killing a lot of people, and possibly killing yourself over a text message , a silly video, or a phone call. That's why there is a law that says, it's illegal to drive and text at the same time, or hold your phone to your ear while driving.

The law basically says a person cannot have a phone in their hand or on any part of their body like their leg or arm or stomach to support a phone. A person can only use their phones to make or get phone calls if they use speakerphone, earpiece, wireless headphones or the phone is connected to the vehicle or electronic watch. The

Hands-Free Georgia Act started July 1, 2018.

There are alternatives to holding your phones, Businesses are creating hands free phone holders, with many different styles to appeal to all.. The hands free phone holder can be put on your windshield on the left side of your wheel.

I also feel that with the distractions that cell phones cause while driving, which can turn into accidents, end up costing a person money, because of the damage from the car wrecks that may happen. Car Insurances are taking a lot of your money because of damaging other cars while texting and driving. The accidents also make your insurance increase which is more money out of your pocket. There is also the possibility of receiving several tickets as well for using your cell phone while driving, which is more money gone.

There should be a lesson learned, which is no hand held talking while driving, no texting and driving and no social media and driving, not to cause accidents. Their is no way that you should be answering your phone while driving, let it go to voicemail or call them back later. For those who care about others don't text and drive at the same time. Keep others safe and your loved ones together. Abbied by the rules follow direction then you will never ever have to pay for any damages or worry about any injuries or death.",0
"The Electoral Colleage is not a Colleage like it sounds, but it is a process. It is a verry complex process and sofar since our government was started it is working fine, right? Well you are wrong. First, let me give a brief explanation what the electoral College is. It is a process that our government has ben using for a very long time that was started in the constitution. What it does, Each state has a number of people in it pledged to a president, such as Obama. When the people vote, it goes to those people and then they vote on who got the majority. Sometimes, this docent work. Some of these ""people"" dont stick to their pledge and vote for someone els, like if 70% of the votes were for Bill, he is supposto vote for Bill. He docent half to and can vote for Bob instead, and this is the big problem with tis method.

florida has 29 people representing it. Places such as California and Texas have 55, and 38, But if you look at places such as hawaii and Alaska, they have around 3 or voters. They have less voters because there population is less than the places with higher amounts of voters. Here is another problem, the bigger states like Texas, California, florida, etc. have a MASSIVE advantage over these places with less people. I believe that votes should be directly by how many people choose someone and whoever gets the higher vote, wins. It's WAY simpler than the way currently used and the more simple something is, the less problems occur.

One argument agenst this way of ""the higher vote wins"" is that it is possible that the votes are so close that there is no clear winner, but with the current way, if there is a tie in the electoral colleage, then it goes to the peoples votes. In 1968, if just 41,71 votes would have made it a tie, and thats extremely close. Dont YOU want to vote for the president, or would you rather vote for someone to vote for ho you want and they could be corrupt and vote for the opposite that they are supposto vote for wich has happened.

If people decided to rid of this mess of a voting system called ""The Electoral College"", wich would be a big leap to accomplish due to the ammount of supporters, would be a great accomplashment. It would also lead to those 29 people in flordia living off of doing practicly nothing and getting money having to get a real job to get money. These would be the people that try and not get rid of it and tell the good parts of it and most likley lie like most government people do, all so they can get money, withought doing practicly anything. In the 2000's, Al Gore recieved more votes than his opponent, George Bush. Bush wone even though more people wanted gore, and this happened because the Electoral College gave Bush more votes, making him win the election. Dosent is seem wrong that the people wanted Gore, but we still got Bush?

Not all of these people working in the Electoral College are like this though, Some might actuially believe it's a good idea to keep it and are a part of it not for the money. When people advertise for who to vote for, they dont advertise in Alaska or Rhode island, They advertise to the states with the most Electoral Colleage members are, such as florida, Texas, and California.",0
"I know cars are the center of our lifes, it's how we get from place to place. So when I tell you that limiting car usage could actually be better for us you would probably tell me i'm crazy. Studies show that people are less stressed without cars, there is less greenhouse gases in the atmoshere, and lower smog.

We probably would not think that limiting our car usage and walking more would make us less stressed. It's true a city in Germany has gone car free. They did a survey on everybody in town and they all say that it has reduced there stress. You are always stressed while you are driving, worried you are going to crash into someone, worried someone will crash into you. Everyone would be happier if we just got rid of cars.

Another benefit about limiting car usage is that there is less greenhouse gases going into the atmoshere. Scientists did a study if we did not use cars the temperature would be three to four degrease cooler in the summer. So just think when the temperature is in the 90's you are going to want that four degrease difference. Cars are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gases here in the united states. The greenhouse gases slowly eat away at the ozone layer making it thinner and thinner, that's what is making the temperature hotter and hotter.

These are all reasons why it would benefit to get rid of cars. It wouldnt kill you to walk a few blocks to work. by doing that you would be putting less stress on you and limiting the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",0
"""Hey Generic_Name! I'm trying to ask out this girl but I don't know what to say, so I need some advice."" Generic_Name said, ""Oh okay. You should tell her..."" I said ""I need some more advice because his advice might not work.""

People seek multiple advice because they can get more than one answer to a problem. They do that so they can summarize and break down each advice that was given to see which works well with your problem. If someone ask you the same question, it will help you give another person some advice and help them. If you ask only one person for advice then you will barely get any information for the problem.

Pros:

It will help you give another person advice that was giving to you before

People give you multiple answers and use which one that will work out well.

It will give you a plan B if the first advice doesn't work

Cons:

They could give you bad advice and will effect you.

Before you get advice, ask someone that has experience it before or know about it. If they've never experience it before or know about it then they could give you the wrong advice or they wont know. I ask for multiple advice before and it works out well because someone gave me a lot of advice to a certain problem I had. So this is a good idea if you need some advice.",0
"The auther suggedts that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I agree with the author, studying Venus could be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presests. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot, and the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. ""Venus, sometimes called the 'Evening Star', is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot""(Paragraph 1).""Often referred to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distant""(Paragraph 2). However, I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I have couple reasons why I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

First of all, about 97 percent of a thick atmosphere blankets Venus are carbon dioxide. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working on study about the planet, Venus. If NASA is possible to make spacecraft that could go to land on the surface of Venus, it will be difficult people research on the planet because 97 percent of the atmosphere are carbon dioxide. This condition makes different envionment from Earth.""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus""(Paragraph 3).

Secondly, the average temperatures of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit""(Paragraph 3). It is not possible that people stay on Venus on this very high temperature.

Finally, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on Earth.""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). For example, if a person's weight is 70kg, the weight will chage t o 630kg on Venus. It is difficult to work on researching on enus.

In addition, beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. ""Beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(Paragraph 3).

Therefore, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density nd size, and occasionally the closest in distance. However, because of some reasons that I mensioned above, studing Venus could be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0
"Some students take online classes they think is good to take more classes than in classroom.

However, when they need to turn the work and they are stuck in problem they can not find teacher to help them, or the device has broken, so students they can not turn the work.

Although some people think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it is actually true that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there are no teacher for help them and some students they do not have internet at home.

When the students find a problem they will need teacher for help them to turn the work before the deadline.

However, if there are no teacher for helps them, then students will can not turn the work on time and students will get bad grade.

As result, one student is takes class online, in one day he find problem that he can not understand it and there are no teacher for help him, then he get bad grade because he can not understand the problem to turn the work on time.

So, if the students take the classes in classroom they will turn the work on time because there are teacher in classroom.

Therefore, students need teacher for solve the problem that the students was stuck on it to turn the work.

Some student they do not have internet at home or they do not have good internet to do the work.

However. some students when they do the work they can not submit it before time end because they do not have good internet.

As result, one student he live in area that they do not have good internet, so when he want to submit the work the network does not working and then he get bad score because he did not submit the work.

So, if the students take the classes in classroom they do not need internet to submit the work.

Therefore, students they do not need internet to submit the work in classroom.

To conclude, students will benefit from taking the classes in classroom to get good grade, understand the lesson and learn form lessons to help them in life time.

Therefore, classroom was benefit more than take the classes online because students will find teacher to help them and they do not need internet to turn the work. ",0
"Students and their families should consider any activitie that they want to get involved in school before getting in. If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also won't be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have.

First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school.

If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities.

If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities.

Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didn't understand in the class.

I think Schools should not control students involvents.

Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students. When students are responsible with their shool work, and their activities, they should get extra credit.      ",0
"If it was made by aliens wouldn't it look less like a face? To me it lookes like it was formed like that because you can tell that after so many years it faded away. in 1976 it lookes like a face and then in 1998 it lookes like a normal rock formimg,in 2001 it doesnt even look like a face at all.

Think about it if an alien made it wouldn't it look more creative or more unlike a face,because really the NASA dosnt even know if aliens are real, if they are real it doesn't mean they would make something like a face. you can tell because in the passage it says that scientists figured out it was just another mesa.

you can also tell because in paragragh 3 it says it was created by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. In the passage it says what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a mesa-landforms common around the american west. so it is likley to happen.",0
"Have you ever heard about the face on Mars? A lot of people have. NASA sent the Viking one up into space to try and capture pictures of mars. The Viking was taking pictures when it noticed a shadowy figure. Can you guess what that figure is? Conspiracy theorists have their own vision of what it was made by, but NASA's scientists had the facts about it!

In paragraph two it says, ""The sensation of the face was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" The conspiracy theorists think otherwise. The conspiracy theorists think that the face was made by Aliens. They also think that the face was really think that it was made by Aliens, and that NASA knows it was, but they just do not want to reveal it. Conspiracy theorists think it's Bona Fide, and that it's evidence of life on Mars. This all shows that the conspiracy theorists have different points of view than the NASA scientists do.

In paragraph seven it says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting then the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" When scientists put the image out online not everyone was satisfied with what the scientists said. Conspiracy theorists still think that it was made by Aliens. This shows that the scientists at NASA have facts and that the conspiracy theorists have only a picture.

In paragraph eleven Garvin says, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects in this picture like aiplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" In paragraph twelve it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Garvin added, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This shows that NASA thinks that the face was just a natural landd form. Everyone else thinks that it was made by Aliens.

In paragraph eight it says that the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Now everyone is saying, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" They all think now possibly they were made by Aliens. This shows that we may have made a serious mistake in how the face was made. The face could've been made by both natural forming or by aliens.

In conclusion, the face could have been made by Aliens and we just do not know it. We could have been wrong for all we know! So we need to think to not doubt ourselves. We all need to think, was the face really made by aliens? It could've been! We need to learn to work together on our theories not against each other. Just think if NASA would've worked with the conspiracy theorists then we could've figured out what really made the face on Mars!",0
"All around the world, cars have influence our lives for the good or for the bad. Whether that is getting people to their jobs or getting into an accident. Cars have altered our lives and are doing it constantly. Although for a century cars have benefited humans greatly, cars have negative effects and banning cars can help decrease the pollution all over the world, it saves the little resoucers the planet has, and car accidents will occur less.

To elaborate more, countries all over the world are trying new ways to decrease the air pollution as much as possible, whether that is banning cars or restricting them. In Vauban, German cars are restricted and if you have a car it is very expensive to use. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not have cars, and inorder to move in to the town 57 percent sold their cars. The idea of restricted areas are getting big ,and for Vuaban has 5,500 residents, that shows that people like the idea and will support it. People in the town have claim to enjoy it alot and are happier. In Paris, France their idea to help low the pollution in the air was to have specific licenses plats restricted on certain days of the week. France had very bad smog and within 5 days the smog decrease 60 percent. In Bogota, Columbia they had similar goals as other countries like Germany. Carlos Arturo Plaza said,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Europe cars make up 12 percent of the greenhouse gas and air pollution. In the United States Americans are driving less and the pollution in the air is decreasing, benefiting the environment. Throughout the world, countries are tring to help the world, by decreasing the pollution.

Moreover, throughout the century cars have been using non renewable resoucers and now that alot of the people have cars, it has taken a toll on the environment. The world has only so much resoucers and once its gone it is gone, it takes time for them to come back and it willl not be in our life time. Using these resoucers have a negative effect they emit carbon in to the atmosphere creating greenhouse gas, that is bad. saving the resoucers and not using them can help with keeping the atmopshere cleaner.

Now people are banning and restricting cars for various reasons, but one reason is that for the past century cars have killed alot of people. It is one of the top reasons for deaths in the United States and possibly in the world. If banning cars can save thousands of lifes why not do it. Banning cars or restricting cars means less cars which can result to less car accidents. Having less accidents results to less people getting hurt and potenially dying. Less cars can also mean that the goverment does have to focuse on roads and stuff like that ,but can focuse on improving the safty of the people on the sidewalks or at playgrounds. the funds can go to better causes.

The world we live has changed enormously and now inorder to save the plant and the people in it, we must make changes as a society, inorder to live long and healthy. Banning cars might be one of the many choices we must make inorder to live. Banning cars can help decrease the greenhouse gases, conserve the resoucers, and less people will die from car accidents. Who knows cars may be a thing in the past int he next decade or two.",0
"In this day and age, car ownership is extremely common among people of all demographics, despite its negative effects on the environment. Cars burn fuels incompletely, releasing harmful byproducts into the atmosphere that can cause thick smog to occur, among other things. Many people have realized the damage caused and have abstained from using personal motor vehicles, or have at least decreased in their use. However, many people still do not know all the advantages that come from living a car-free lifestyle. Living without a car may seem daunting at first due to its reputation as the most popular mode of transportation since its inception. When these preconcieved notions are brushed aside, the benefits can shine through. Limiting car usage is not only cost-effective, but it also dramatically decreases greenhouse gas emissions, lowers obesity, and allows people to conserve the non-renewable resources that cars depend on. Cleaner cities lead to less illness and a better quality of life for its citizens.

Limiting car usage can be very cost-effective, especially in a place like Vauban, Germany. In this particular town, it costs $40,000 just to park, not including the costs of the actual car, gas, tolls, and repairs that come with being a car owner. It is much more inexpensive to simply walk, bike, or utilize public transportation. People may have to give up a small amount of convienience, but they will surely enjoy the spike in their finances once they become accustomed to life without a car.

Without cars, an opening becomes apparent for cheap transportation. Walking, biking, and skating can replace the need for cars. These methods require people to put in effort to get to their destination. This effort burns calories for energy and allows the user to commute and exercise at the same time, allowing people to lead healthier, more active lifestyles. With the current obesity epidemic occurring in the United States, human-powered transportation is a viable option that is worth considering for the sake of America's heath. If cars are banned, cities will build more and more bike paths to accomodate the needs of the people just as it has happened in Bogota, Columbia. Reducing obesity would mean reclaiming the millions of dollars lost each year to healthcare costs on obesity related illnesses, such as heart disease. Cutting out cars could be the healthiest choice people ever make.

Greenhouse gases trap heat near Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss. Car emissions are a large part of the total emissions released, but that has the potential to change. Building cities closer together promotes walking in leiu of driving and reduces the amount of cars on te road, spewing their toxic byproducts. Slowing down climate change should be the most important reason why cities everywhere should take the initiative and eliminate cars.

Any small inconvience caused by not owning a personal vehicle is quickly outweighed by all the benefits the world can reap through getting rid of cars, once and for all. The problems they have inflicted on the world can finally be neutralized.",0
"When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person. It is better to talk to more people than just one. The reason why it is always better talk to multiple people is because the more people you talk to the more advice you have. The least people you talk to the less advice you have.

When you talk to a lot of more people you have more varieties of advice to pick the one you want to use. Some people have negative thoughts in there mind and when they ask for advice that can help them out a whole lot. Then when they get a lot of good advice of what to do, and how to not have negative thoughts. This can change there life a whole lot and really help them out.

Whenever someone ask for advice you should always give them it, because you never know what they are going through. Also that advice can be very helpful to them.

When asking for advice you should never ask just one person to get advice from always ask multiple, like family or close friends so it is more choices to pick from.

Some people can be about to do something very bad that can make them go to jail, or hurt themselves. So you have to step up and stop them from doing it by giving them good advice. Therefore, When giving or getting advice always give it to multiple people or receive it from multiple people.",0
"Are you confused, angry, or sad? What if a computer could help you understand more to take away your confusion. Technology has been advancing little by little and we are at the point in time where a computer is now able to read your face and emotions. Two professers have been working hard to create a new software that can recognize emotions. They are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

Most students are now learning lessons planned by their techers' via laptops and etc. Sometimes students struggle to comprehend their teahcer's lessons and tend to be confused because of the way they are taught. Every student learns a different way and sometimes the teacher runs out of options to help the student understand. Now, computers have a different mind. They are more ""intelligent"" than humans. They can program different things for different people. This new software could be very valubale in a classroom because it can help explain things in ways that a teacher can't and will be able to adjust to the students comprehension.

Math can be a very stressful and difficult subject to comprehend. Sometimes teachers cant explain how to solve an equation easily which is how computers could help do those things. If you're reading through your teachers lesson and see his/her explanation on how to solve but you don't quite understand it, you tend to make a face of confusion. The computer may read that and see that you are having difficulty understanding the issue and may make the work easier for you to understand.

Last but not least, some student's tend to get frustrated or annoyed and decide to give up. A student giving up is not a good thing because they then don't learn what they were meant to learn. The computer may notice that a child is getting annoyed or upset and can find a different more fun and entertaining way to help the student. Just a simple change in the form of the lesson may give a student motivation to learn instead of quitting and giving up. Sometimes all a student needs is for something to be adjusted to their understanding and level.

This software created by two professers could be very valuable in a classroom. There are many benefits it could bring but there are some problems it could cause as well. Overall, this software will have a positive effect to help a child know they can be helped to understand what they dont. It could produce a new learning enviornment to the students comprehension and many test grades and etc could improve.",0
"The author explains why studying Venus is an important thing by stating the facts about how it is beneficial to us to study our sister planet. Do to to our current limit in technology and the harsh ecosystem on Venus, it is is extremely hard for us to find out any information about this planet. Many people wonder why scientist still try to find out more information about Venus. The reason is that Venus's ecosystem could have been similar to ours many years ago. Since the planet shows signs of mountains, valleys and craters we can safley assume their was once an ocean on the now uninhabitable planet. Many scientist believe that we can safley hover above Venus's atomsphere to get a better look at it. However other scientist state that they want to go on to the planet to take samples of rock, gas ect. Either way going to Venus will not be happening anytime soon.",0
"Have you ever heard about the face on Mars' surface? People think that it could be aliens, but more people believe that it is just a mesa or a butte. The Viking 1 gathered the first pictures of the face ever. Many conspiracy theorists think that NASA knows that it is evidence of an ancient alien race. It still remains somewhat a mystery to people all over the internet.

The Viking one captured the first pictures of the face in history. It was searching for landing spot for it's sister ship. The mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised when it popped up on their monitors. The pictures surfaced on the internet a few days later. It was a great way to get people engaged in the attraction to Mars.

Although NASA and conspiracy theorists would be happy to discover that the face is evidence of an ancient alien race on Mars. The formation is probably just a mesa or a butte. They are both landforms common to the American West. Garvin commented'' It reminds me of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.''A lava dome that takes form of a mesa around t he same height as the one Mars.

If the face on mars was an alien artifact NASA would be famous for finding it.

Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding the fact that the face is an alien artifact,but NASA would not be hiding the fact that it is from aliens if it were because it would benefit them a bunch. For example they could make a ton of money from the publicity of it being something alien. With the money they could fund even more projects like sending rovers to Mars to try and find out more about the face, and maybe they could even be able to get humans to Mars. It would get people interested in Mars and they would want more pictures and evidence of it being an alien artifact. That is why it would not make sence for NASA to tell people on the internet that the face is an something alien instead of just being a mesa or a butte.

In conclusion there is a lot more evidence that the face is a mesa or a butte other than an alien artifact. Even though conspiracy theorists are convinced they have proof of alien lifeform. Most evidence points to it being a landform, like a mesa or a butte. There is also not any logical reason for NASA to hide the idea that it is evidence of aliens if it were true. These are just a few of the reasons that I believe that it is just a landform and not any evidence of an alien lifeform. The rest of the internet should realize that it is not anything alien too.",0
"Often times, people don't ask for advice from more than one person, which can sometimes result in bad decision making. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can get different perspectives, receive help from people who are highly experienced, and be given the chance to have a brighter future.

One of the reasons seeking multiple opinions helps someone make a better choice is because they can get different perspectives. People can listen to others' point of view, which may make it easier for them to decide what decision they're going to make. For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year. Finally, after listening to both sides, I decided to take Geometry Honors. Listening to different perspectives can be beneficial, but people can also receive help from people who are more experienced than them.

Another reason seeking multiple opinions helps someone make a better choice is because they can get help from people who are highly experienced in their field. Receiving help from professionals doesn't necessarily mean that they know what's best for someone, but they can certainly serve as assistance if someone is facing a problem. For instance, a couple of months ago, my friend Generic_Name was struggling with drafting her college resume. She was at a disadvantage because she didn't know what steps to follow to write her resume, and the worst part of it all was that her school guidance counselor was unwilling to take the time to help her. At first, she attempted to write it herself without any guidance, but then her old friend, Generic_Name, who already graduated from college and is now an English professor at Generic_School, was visiting during that week. He noticed how frustrated she was with her essay, and decided to sit down with her and give her some pointers. After finalizing her resume to the best of her ability, Generic_Name decided to make a copy of it to give to her English teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, who is a notable alum from Harvard University. Ms. Generic_Name gave her some feedback, but overall, her paper was ready to submit. Generic_Name sent it out to Santa Monica University, and received her acceptance letter a few months later. Receiving help from highly experienced people can also lead to a brighter future.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions helps someone make a better choice because they can be given the chance to have a brighter future. By making just one decision, your life can turn upside down. For example, my close friend, Generic_Name, just graduated from CalTech with his Bachelors and Masters Degree in cyber security and software development. He's thinking of applying to Microsoft to be an engineering coordinator, but he's unsure if he will be accepted. He knows that hundreds of thousands of candidates apply each year, but only a small number of people are accepted. Generic_Name decides to ask for advice from one of his friends, Generic_Name, who currently works at Microsoft. Generic_Name told him that with his work ethic, he would surely get fired during his first week of the job. Generic_Name wasn't sure if this was constructive criticism, or if Generic_Name was jealous of him and wanted to see him fail. Generic_Name thought about it, and decided to ask his college professor, Mr. Generic_Name, what he thinks he should do. He told him that he would thrive working at Microsoft and he would regret it if he didn't apply. After much consideration, he decided to apply. Five months later, he received his acceptance letter in the mail and happily took the job. He is now well known throughout the country. If someone is given the chance to do something great, they shouldn't turn it down.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can listen to others' point of view, get help from trained professionals, and can be given the opportunity to have a successful future. People should take initiative to ask for help and shouldn't rely on only one person's opinion.",0
"The first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree about that, cause me personal i don't have issues with no one around me. Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesn't mean that they don't like me. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didn't like me that much so we didn't talk too much. He didn't even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didn't like me because I was dating someone he liked that's what happen.

My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasn't I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked.

I don't get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I don't have issues with no one around me. It's just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. So go and look for that its's not difficult to have that. If you only have personality that good or have charisma that even greater to have, sighing out.                ",0
"The extensive use of car transportation is setting a cloud over our society, literally. Car transportation is so heavily depended on in the current generation that people don't realize the negatives it has on our environment, local businesses, and people's lives in general. transportation is not a priority and there are numerous advantages to gain out of limiting the use of cars the smog percentages in the atmosphere will decline and create an everlasting clear environment and magnificent clarity built skies, local businesses that are run by families in suburbs will see their popularity rising back up to their previous points before malls in distant areas took over, the stress of supporting a cars expenses will be relieved, and people will realize that we connect just as well through the internet rather than driving to meet friends.

Although cars are used by a vast amount of the population, the impact it has on the environment is withoutadoubt an ongoing situation that needs to be taken care of. The author states in the passage that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. That should automatically tell you that these vehicles are putting an impact on our environment. Limiting the permission that citizens have of using their cars temporarily has shown a massive decrease in the smog build up that takes up a rather large percentage in most cities, in source 2, paragraph 12 the author states the outcome of Paris permitting drivers with evennumbered licenses from driving this saw smog levels clear up enough to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. If only temporarily holding people back from driving can affect our environment so positively, imagine what the output would be if the world repeated this action on a much larger scale.

Furthermore, cars promote the popularity of malls, which takes away the attention from numerous local businesses. These local stores are ran by families that need customers to keep their system alive, and if cars are traveling a further distance to reach malls, it just takes away the money needed by these local businesses. Living in small communities and suburbs is a great solution to this problem and has proven to work already, for instance The suburb of Vauban, Germany stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant high way.

Another advantage of limititing car usage would be the lessening of stress, so many people have the burden of paying expensive car bills and having to work more than one job just to keep up with the numerous payments cars require, accidents are also caused by the massive amount of cars that are already in use on the roads. If people would carpool more often or take public transporations such as buses and trains, we would see an immense improvement of families income and we'd expect a safer society as a whole, safer from the hazards caused by the humongous majority of vehicle transportation. Having a car isn't a priority, working a job close to home and using bus transportation will be benfitial to your community, just plan out your approach and you'll soon understand why having a car isn't always necessary.

All in all, putting a stop to the extensive of cars will mainly bring out the pros, people always say they want to see the world become less polluted and free from toxic gases, limiting car usage is the first step to achieving this goal as we'd see smog in our skies clear out, your local businesses can step back into popularity and connect your community even more rather than traveling a far distance to reach malls. And finally, one of the main advantages would be the effect is has on you. All your money stresses will be relieved and you'll be able to focus on something more important than a car bill. The world is noticing these possibilities and we are heading for a chage on step at a time.",0
"The author didnt support this claim very well. The author talked alot about the dangers in Venus rather the good that comes from Venus. I say this because as I am reading I see how the author mentions many of times how Venus has extreme tempetures and how no one has went to Venus because of these extreme conditions.

The author says in paragraph 2 ,""Numerous factors contribute to Venuss reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" Which gives the idea that it is a very dangerous place. You may begin to question ""Why would any one want to go to Venus"" or you may say to yourself ""This is not any where that i would want to go."" The author also states in paragraph 3,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere."" This is even more if a danger sign. No one would want to be anywhere where you could potentially suffocate. We also know from this paragraph that Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The author states in paragraph 6 ,""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" The author gives us tons and tons of reasons why it is not worth going to Venus.

From what I have read today I will never want to go to Venus. The author gave plenty of good reasons on why we should not go to Venus. It is not a place for humas as we have already read. So i feel as if the author did not do a good job supporting his claim on why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present.",0
"The Electoral College is a process in which electors pick the president instead of the people, but is it worth keeping. No, the Electoral College is not worth keeping because it reflects the view of the electors instead of  the people.

Some people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certaintity of the outcome ( source 3 paragoh 18). However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win (source 3 paragraph 19). This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the canditate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory. In all the Electoral College should be abolished becasue it takes away say of the people.

Not only does the Electoral college take away the say of the people, it also has no protection against a tie of states that have an even number of electors (source 2 paragraph 11). For instance a state like hawaii that has a total of two electors if they both vote for differnt people then how are the votes decided well it already happened in 1960,but Richard Nixon who was the vice president at the time and known to be against the Electoral College decided to only aknowledge his opponents electors. That is why we should abolish the Electoral College.

Allow me ask a hypothetical question what if the electors were corrupt and voted for whomever they pleased without even considring the peoples vote (source 1 paragrqaph 2). We have no system to ensure that the people vote matters but the electors does therefore electors that are picked by former canditates may be more likely to return the favor and ignore the peoples vote and vote for their canditate. There are many important figures whom are against the Electoral College such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter,  and Bob Dale there are many more but thes are all politicians who see the Electoral College the same way the people do (source 2 paragraph).

In all the Electoral college should be abolished because it ignores the peoples votes. The votes that werre granted to the people by the constitution therefore the Electoral College not only doesn't care about the people, but it is also violating their constitutional rights.",0
"The idea of using facial recognition technology to identify how someone is feeling is a new one. It is also a preposturous one. You cannot fully understand what someone is feeling by looking at their face, and attempting to do so is an invasion of their privacy. Facial action coding systems should not be used in classrooms.

The idea that you could fully decipher what someone is feeling based on how they look is absurd. You cannot decide for yourself how someone feels based on the movement of their muscles. For example, if someone looks sad, you cannot just decide that they are sad, just because they look that way. If a machine decides I look confused, does it really have the right to change what I am learning? To understand how someone is really feeling, you have to first ask yourself why they might be feeling that way. Once you understand this, then you can determine what is happening. A machine cannot read minds. If I am confused about one thing, the machine does not know what. Not to mention that people often feel varying emotions at varying times of the day. I might be sad one minute, then laugh at a joke the next. I might not understand something, than understand it in the next second. The machine might automatically change something I understood based on a few seconds of confusion. This is not efficient or helpful.

To read someone's emotions based on their facial expressions is an invasion of their privacy. Let's assume this machine can accurately decipher someone's emotions based on muscle movement. What if you don't want people to know how you're feeling? If I am confused about something, and I am embarrased about it, suddenly the whole word knows. It should be up to the student to decide whether or not they want to seek help, not some magical machine. By forcing students to share private emotions, you run the risk of making them less willing to go to school. Who would want to go to a school where everyone knows how you feel at all times of the day? That would affect learning severely, and would definitely do more harm than good. Hindering learning in an attempt to better understand students is not worth it.

Using this software in classrooms would be ineffective, and even if it did work, it would be a huge invasion of privacy. This software should be used on paintings and nothing more. It is not accurate enough to do anything other than hold back human learning. This software is not fit for classrooms.",0
"Car Free Cities

Could you imagine living in a place without cars? Or even in a place where there were cars,but nobody used them? That is not a place I would want to live in. I enjoy driving my car, and many of my friends enjoy cruising dirt roads in their trucks. Driving is not just a way of transportation, it is a way of life. There are some people that don't want to drive. There are some people that don't want anybody to drive. There are people and governments trying to take away the right to drive an automobile on certain days. It seems like a huge hit, which is good for the government promoting it, because if people had anything better to do, the idea wouldn't last a second. Take the ""Car-free day"" in Bogota, Colombia for example. It was started in the mid-1990s. My source said that millions of Colombians took alternate approaches to getting around on this day. However, I must also take into consideration that this article was written in 2002. There has been a lot of change since 2002. In 2002 I didn't even know how to ride a bicycle, and now I've got my driver's license. I can't really infer how many take part in this event nowadays, but it said millions participated twelve years ago. I would think that if that was the majority of people in the designated areas, then they would've wrote the impressive percentage of people that participated. However, they did not. The article just says millions. How many millions of people? Two million people, three millions people, ten million people? It doesn't say how many millions as if to suggest that the writers of this article think that just writing ""millions"" of people is enough evidence to impress the reader. For all i know, only ten percent of the people in Colombia may have taken part in Car-free day. Also, it says the fine for violating the Car-free day is $25 dollars with the exception to buses and taxis. This sounds more to me like a scam to get people to use more buses and taxis. $25 dollars where I live isn't hardly anything. I can find that much walking down the sidewalk. In Colombia, however, i do not know how much that is. Especially in the capitol city, where I'm sure there is plenty of poverty just as there is in the majority of large cities in the U.S. The article did not specify how much money $25 dollars is over there related to in the United States. So when it boils down to it, the citizens of Colombia didn't have many choices for transportation. They could walk or ride a bicycle, probably the cheapest way. They could take a bus or taxi which would most likely be free, but it would be pointless because if the reason for this campaign is really what officials claim it is- to reduce pollution, then they're just making it worse having people take buses instead of driving they're own cars. I'm positive my car gets more mpg than the buses they're using in Colombia. So I'm sure there were quite a lot of people that participated in the event, but I'm not convinces they all did it for the right cause.

I am totally against taking away cars. I do not care if they take away cars in other countries. I think it would be wrong and unfair to the people, but it doesn't apply to me, therefore I'm not concerned too much. However, if they tried to ban the use of cars in the U.S, I think there would be an outrage. My dad is a self-employed floor installer, but in his mean time he works on cars. He is good at working on cars. If he wanted to, he could easily open up a body shop out of his garage, but he doesn't want to. He doesn't want to work on cars for other people and he don't care about the money he could make doing it. He wants to work on his own cars for no other reason than that he enjoys doing it. His dad taught him how to fix cars. My grandpa was also a mechanic before he retired. He had his own small-town body shop where people from all around would bring there cars for him to fix. He did very well financially for auto-mechanic. I do not share the same love for cars that they do. When i was growing up i didn't want to be in a garage, i wanted to be in a pool or on a basketball court. That's not to say that i don't love my car though, and enjoy driving it. I'm sixteen years old, I've had my license for about six months, and I've had my own car for about 9 months. In source 4: The End of Car Culture, the author talks about her sons compared to Mr. Sivak's sons. Her sons have little interest in obtaining a license. I know very few people like that in my life. Most of my friends and I love our automobiles and we love being able to drive. It's a good sense of self-responsibility that prepares us for the responsibility we will encounter as adults.

In a world where everybody walks, bikes, hikes, or takes buses and taxis, I would be miserable. I would hate walking or biking to work everyday and everywhere I go. Every time i arrived i would be drenching in sweat. I would hate taking a bus just as much because it would most likely be crammed full of tons of people who are incapable or too lazy to walk and bike to get around. If buses today are already uncomfortable, could you imagine them twice as full? Taxis would probably be the worst. They would be the only means of comfortable transportation. Could you imagine the price of using a taxi in a world without private cars. It would skyrocket. The fare would be outrageous. I hope i never live to experience a time where i will get a ticket and fine just for driving my car on a certain day of the week.",0
"I was very excited about my first trip to the West Coast (California) that I took last summer. It was a place Ive always fantazized over because of its variety of beauty from the surfing beaches to the skiing mountains to the north. When I first landed in LA, I expected some hustle and bustle of the city like Miami, but it was overwhelming to see the smog and traffic that polluted many peoples views of California, along with the air. Unfortunately, this is the case in many car intensive cities across the globe where limiting car usage would go a great deal farther than people actually know. The advantages of limiting car usage would allow for cleaner cities with less air pollution, and provide safety for pedestrians and even other car-users.

According to source 1 on car-free cities, Elizabeth Rosenthal states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 5). This stat only presents part of the problem as the commercial and delivery industry add to that figure as well. Limiting car usage across the world is becoming more and more porular, as people finally come to realize the devastating effects of the greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere. Projects in places like France, Colombia, the United States, and other countries across the globe are making a huge effort at reducing car usage, and according to source 4 by Rosenthal, they seem to be working. "" Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by""(paragraph 29). Obviously, car usage altogether will not end, but limiting it can do a great deal in protecting the only planet sustainable for human life.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars in areas of large pedestarian population, such as New York City, would ultimately lead to less tragic car accidents. Approximately 500 car accidents occur daily in the United States and probably upwards of 5000 across the globe. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in many societies which is unfortunate because almost all are preventable. Its when the driver is given too much power behind the wheel that their guard is let down. The rise of cellphones and texting have not helped the situation at all either. The good news is that the programs used worldwide solely for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are also reducing car accidents. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Duffer, paragraph 14). Also in source 3 describing Bogota's Car free day is spreading to other countries of Latin-America with the intention of reducing traffic and allowing safer passage for pedestrians.

Ultimately, the importance of limiting car-usage across the world is being seen as crucial and is starting to take off. Limiting car usage reduces air pollution which is a serious threat to humanity these days, and also diminishes car related accidents. At the end of my trip to California, I was able to see the real beauty of the nature outside the city, when I got off the highway.",0
"Phones and Driving

Have you ever wondered about the dangers of operating a phone while driving? Should people be able to use a phone while driving a car? Will there be a future of using phone while driving? There is a great percentage of drivers that use their phones while driving a car. With many opportunities to use a phone while stopped at a red light or stuck in traffic, phones have been a danger to many people. Not being able to use a phone while driving a car is true because of distractions and car crashes.

Using a phone while driving a car is very dangerous. Most car crashes are caused by drivers scrolling through social media, taking pictures, looking at navigation, or searching for music (Evans Moore). Edgar Snyder & Associates states that ""There are about 1.6 million car crashes a year just because the driver is using their phone."" Those car crashes that occurred are all because of drivers attempting to use their phones. Our smartphones are a great resource to have and use but are a major risk to our lives if used at a wrong time and place. Phones should be used before starting the car and used after getting to the desired destination. Drivers should not be able to use a phone while operating a car because they are a distraction and causes many car crashes.

In my personal opinion I don't think people should be able to use a cellphone while operating a car. There are many people lives at stake because of reckless drivers. ""According to the report, cell phones caused 26 percent of car accidents in the U.S. in 2014. Text messaging causes 5 percent of crashes (Bey & Associates)"". Using the phone makes the driver's main focus go from driving to what is on the screen. The reckless drivers cause car accidents and that can cause major injuries. Some of those injuries can cause permanent damage while others are small injuries.

I am pretty positive that there would be a future of using phones and driving. Even though there are many laws that say using a phone while operating a car isn't allowed people still do it on a daily. There are many states that have already banned the usage of phones while driving. ""18 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. All are primary enforcement laws-an officer may cite a driver for using a hand-held cell phone without any other traffic offense taking place (GHSA)."" There are always those who use their phone while driving, but they should be punished for their recklessness.

There would always be a danger to driving and using a phone. The drivers that look at their phones now are already a danger. With the next generation starting to drive there would be an even bigger percentage of accidents. Those who choose to use the phone while driving should suffer the consequences.

"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Prof, Thomas Huang and Beckman institute, have made an invention""FACS"", that is able to tell someones expressions using technology. The author states the emotions of Mona Lisa's portriat by using the new technology. Do you ever think is the new invention even worth the pay or even necessary? Many people can be against it and many for it. Myself personally I am for Facial Action Coding System.

The article states, you can tell someones emotions by just looking at them. It also states that we have trouble really describing the facial trait. By using FACS, we can get the actual facial traits in someones face.

According to the author, ""'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly)."" When using the Facial Action Coding System it recognizes the facial movements in a humans actual face even in paintings. Using the ""While Looking in the Mirror"" activity we followed the steps,but what if we were to add something that nobody knew except you. The person looking at you would think you are following the script. When you use that same exact script with the other facial you added, the technology would recognize it in an instant. The author also stated moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

In conclusion we all have our opinion, if using the FACS is good or not. The Facial Action Coding System is a technology Prof. Thomas Huang And Beckman institue invented to help people figure out what a painting is offering us in emotions or even what people themsleves are offering. Either wanting to use technology or our own brains, the only person who really knows is the person who painted the painting and the person giving the facial expression.",0
"Some people may think that the Face was created by aliens, but it was not. The face is just a natural landform that is a huge rock formation. No aliens were involved in the making of it. Although it has starred in books, films, magazines and talk shows that does not mean it was created by aliens.

To start from the beginning, NASA was just circling Mars taking pictures of possible places where one of the other ships could land. Then it spotted the shadowy rock that looked like a face. A few days after NASA snapped the photo of the Face everyone was engaged in it.

Anyways, the photo that NASA snapped of the Face was not created by aliens. If it was NASA would be looking for any form of life on my Mars instead of just calling it a natural landform.

It was just a landform that was created naturally like the ones on Earth.

In conclusion, I would like to say there is no actual evidence that aliens created the landform or that they exist. The Face was not created by aliens and is just made out of rock that happened to form into the shape of a face and as time goes on it looks less like a face.",0
"To the State Senate, Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popularbased vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fulfilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ""...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" 3. This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" Office of the Federal Register, 1. This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.

According to Plumer, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" 2. This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" 2. This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states..."" 2. This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winnertakeall system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer,2. This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.

Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ""...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid RunOff Elections..."" Posner, 3. These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winnertakesall method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" 3. In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Runoff Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" 3. I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swingstates are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America.",0
"Limiting car usage is a tremendous advantage. Haven't you ever thought why? limiting car usage has its reason why its an advantage. One of the huge reasons is pollution, cars tend to create pollution, congestion, smog and many other harmful things. Source 14 mentions useful information of the disadvantage of owning or driving a car. Source number two mentions how cars tends to create lot of pollution, for this reason in Paris they decided to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Nobody would like to live in a place where you have to be breathing dirty, contaminated air and knowing you produced it by your own car when Paris enforced to ban cars for a few days to clear out the global air not many fellow citizens participated about 4,000 citizen were charged with a fine for not following the rule. why would you try to be disobedient when what they are trying to do is help you clear out the global sir so the citizens living in that area dont get sick with any disease and dont harm our earth where we live. The advantage of limiting car usage will be creating less pollution to have a better global air. Cars aren't the only way to get to place to place there is other way to transport for example public transport like buses, train or even if its not that far walking and itll be a create exercise.

Yes, driving a car could sound great because you get to drive anywhere you want and get to places quicker instead of catching or waiting for a public transport when you need to get somewhere and your in a rush. Cars are a huge hand like a big help because it helps people get from place to place. Also remember that cars arent cheap at all an example is that source number one mentions "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two placesto parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" What this quote is pointing out is that to be able to park a car if you own one it has to be in a specific place and which you have to own and live by there which costs lot of money. Limiting yourself for car usage would make you save up a whole lot of money. Instead of wasting like 40,000 dollars in a parking place for a car and have to be living there you can easily just get on public transport and be able to live where you want. source 1 also mentions "" As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a to move here. when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this also points out the not many people in Germany dont own cars and not owning a car really doesnt bother them because they found better way to get a transport and also believing that Saving up money is a really important thing because when you become independ you have to start paying bills, food, and many other things that wyour parents wont give you anymore so why waste it on gas and car washing instead of just getting somewhere in a easy transport and the money you wouldve been wasting in nonsense now will be saved up for something more useful. thinking about it car limiting is a useful thing finacialy and global reaosns too.

Lastly another advantage of limiting car usage is less congestion the less driving there is the less traffic there will be. Traffic is a big headche to people who try to get to their jobs or certain events on time. Public transportion might ttake long to get there also but its becauise there isnt as much buses because not many people get on public transportion and the less buses there is and more cars who cause traffic the more time it'll take off our time. Source 3 states "" in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams."" Bogota, colombia has a great point doing this event once a year will demonstrate citizen that the less car usage the less traffic jams there with be and it will be more relaxing and calming area to live instead of hearing screaming, beeping and other annoying sounds caused by unpatient people. This event that colombia has done has cause other states to realize that thats a great idea and some tried experminting it in their country.

In conclusion limiting car usage has its great advantages which benefits the citizens living in that area so if it benefits you why not try limiting car usage. Limiting car usage creates less pollution, less traffic jams, and your able to save up your money for something thats actually important. Cars aren't the only way you could get from place to place theres many other options like walking, or riding a public transport theres always an answer to everything. By limiting car usage we create less pollution in the air we breathe and there wil be less harm done to the earth and to the citizens. Always try new things and let limmiting car usage be one of them.",0
"In my opinion, I do not think that the electoral college should be abolished, but I do agree with some of the points that Mr. Plumer claimed. Mr. Plumer stated, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" While it is somewhat unfair and outdated, the electoral college is needed in a sense of today's society. Everytime someone who is African American is murdered or killed, people always think it's a racial matter. Take a look at the incidents that were going on in Ferguson. Michael Brown, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by an officer, who was a white man. The people of Ferguson were literally rioting in the streets over a matter of a cop defending himself. So if that kind of society were to directly vote for our next president, it would be extremely biased. If another African American were to run for president of the United States, most Blacks would vote for him and say things like, ""If he doesn't win presidency, then this country is racist!"" To me, that's how American society is and that's why we should keep the electoral college.

In addition, the electoral college is needed to keep balance and fairness among the country. If there was no electoral college, and the votes came straight from the people, there would be problems regarding the states and the population of those states. For example, California would have a huge advantage at deciding who the next president is over a small state like Maryland. The electoral college is meant to keep balance among most, if not all, the states.

Another reason to keep the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, according to Mr. Posner. He states, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If there was no electoral college, the votes would heavily swing one way or the other, because of regional culture. People in the South would generally vote for someone who is white and Republican, where as the North, or states like Florida and California would vote for someone who is democratic, and since race is a exponentially large matter in today's society, people who are African American would vote for the runnning candidate who is African American or of black descent.

A vote straight from the people could work if racial perspective wasn't a huge factor like it has been since the civil rights movement. But right now, this country needs an electoral college because without one, votes would be based on race, state size, and culture.",0
"May 24,2001 the face on Mars was not made by aliens. NASA thought they saw aleins land on mars and creat the face. This is a mission to find how it was made and who it was made by.

A few days later NASA showed the picture for everyody to see. Authors reasponed it would be a good way to engage the public adn attarct go Mars and it certainly did. The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It was on books and magazines, raido talk shows and haunted grocey store checkout line for 25 years. Mission controllers perpared to look againg at the Mars. One summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew a close enough for a second look. We had to roll a space craft 25 defress to center the Face in the field of view said Garvin.

This is what is think about the face on Mars. That's a lava dome thta takes the form of an islolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars. This is what I think about the Face on Mars today.",0
"When you ask multiple people for advice, you are most likey to make the decision that everyone is satisfied with. Asking only one person does not give you the advantage of hearing different opinons. If you ask multiple people, the best answer will be brought up more than once. Listening to multiple people and their solutions may help you come up with an idea that you have not thought of. Only asking one person for advice is less beneficial, for everyone and for yourself.

Asking multiple people for advice will give you different perspectives on how you should handle the problem. When choosing what to do, having an idea of what might happen next will impact your final say for the better. Having different opinions on the matter will help you rule out the unfavorable ones, and leave you with the ones you are most satisfied with. The people you ask will provide you with perspectives that you did not think of, helping you put an end to your issue.

Multiple people being asked the same question will definitely bring up the same answer more than once. On an issue that requires guidance, your friends will probably bring up the answer that another friend already brought up. Getting the same solution over and over again may mean that it is the most reasonable answer. Asking only one friend may prevent you from getting the answer that makes the most sense.

Getting advice from multiple people may help you come up with an answer you did not think of. Getting different perspectives might help you to come up with your opinion on the matter. Your friends opinion may influence your own, creating a solution you did not think about. If you ask only one friend you get only one perspective to help influence your own for the better or worst.

Asking multiple people is the best way to insure that you will get the answer that sits well with everyone. If you ask one person their answer could be affected by other variables, so asking multiple people is your best and safest bet. The benefits of asking more than one person for advice are huge so you should be taking advantage of that. When you do ask the ones you trust for advice, the solution will eventually make its way to you.",0
"Although, many people may think that going to Venus despite the dangers is not a good idea going to venus can also be benitfical with new safety measures, and technolgy.

One reason is, Venus is a sister planet to Earth but we don't know alot about it so we need to go there. Going to venus can be benitfical in may ways. One way is thet it can give scientist good research that they don't have. It can also give them a way as said in the article ""to examine more closely"". Lastly we could gain more knowledge on living conditions in Venus.

Even though, Venus is not the safest palce for anyone or anything to be NASA has came up with new safetey measures to ensure the people's safetey. For one as said in the article Venus is a hot place. So NASA has came up with the idea that the people that will be going to venus would be floating on top of venus so that they will not only be safe but alive. Another way to ensure saftey is to use silicon devices since metal melts on Venus, and studies have shown that using silicon is efficient, and in the article is said to last ""for three weeks"".

Furthermore, not only do they have saftey measures they also uses technolgy. From past reasearch it is known that Venus burns metal so that means that to have good resaerch you have to find somthing that is not meatal to conduct your resarch. So NASA has made another project when they look at old technolgy, and they realised that mechanical computers would help when researching Venus. Mechanical computers conduct ""calculations by using gears and levers"". Also mechanical computers does not need electronics at all.

In other words going to Venus can be very resourcful and problaly become of use in the future.",0
"Imagine a world completely pollution free. A world with no worry about greenhouse gases or global warming. While it's highly unlikely that we will get to that point, we can still try to reach this perfectly healthy world. The are many advantages tolimiting car use, some of those advantages would be: reducing stress, reducing the amount of pollution, and saving money.

Stress is a feeling that everyone can relate to. Whether it be work, school, money, or home life stressing out about things is not healthy. There has been several studies showing that getting proper exercise has tremendous health benefits. The only problem is that no one ever seems to have time to work out or go on a walk. However, if you had to walk to get wherever you're going, you would easily receive enough exercise to help lower your stress. Plus, driving can be extremely stressful. Without having to sit through traffic or deal with bad drivers an average person's stress levels would plummet. The first passage contains a quote from a suburban mom of two, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier this way."" Recently, I feel as if all I hear about on the news is Greenhouse gases and pollution. Honestly, hearing about global warming is a frightening experience, almost like a glass of cold water being thrown in your face. 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are caused by passenger cars and in parts of the United States it's up to 50 percent! While car companies are helping by rolling out hybrid and electric cars, those cars are very expensive! Not everyone is willing to shell out that kind of money. By reducing car use, the harmful gases polluting our air will greatly decrease and places like Paris,France and Beijing, China both ver heavily polluted places can have clearer air.

Money. Money seems like it rules our world and it really does. Do you enjoy throwing money away? Of course you don't! Well, if you drive a car everywhere you go, you might as well be. Gas prices are high and it takes upwards of 50 dollars to fill the tank of the average car. Not to mention the price of the car itself! While you have to pay for gas, car insurance, maintenance, and the bill for the car if it's not paid off yet, people who walk to work or to the store and don't own a car are saving thousands of dollars a year.

To conclude, when you reduce the use of cars you: reduce stress, reduce the amount of pollution, and save money. If you want to leave the planet Earth healthy and livable for the future generations, you should seriously consider ditching your car and buying a nice pair of walking shoes.",0

"The Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to everyday school life. This computer system can help with several things from elementary school to college. This could also change the way the world works forever. The FACS can easily be an important part of our education society.

The first and most effective thing FACS would impact is student's attitudes in the classroom. If FACS was active on all of the students computers, it could detect their emotions to influence them to get back on track and focus. It could also simply just keep the concentration going about the lesson being instructed. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6) . This can improve the interaction in class and can also improve many students grades.

If FACS was implemented into schools, students would feel more involved in the lecture, and pay attention more while being extra alert. Students will also be more knowledegable due to the fact that they are taking in information and really getting to learn about it, instead of just trying to find the answers that will satisfy on a worksheet or test. While feeling more involved, alert, and learning a lesson with full attention, this will impact grades greatly. This will help even more students proceed on into the next step of education, which is college.

FACS would benefit in grade school and would most definitely continue to help students in college. College can get difficult, but FACS could influence to keep students focused when they seem to become overwhelmed by their expressions. If students are impacted by FACS when they are younger and proceed on to college while continuing their education, there then comes a career. FACS will help in high school to get you to a college of your dreams, also best fit for your major. Then in college, it will help you focus and be actively listening and learning about your major to help you find a career that best fits you and your abilities. If everyone could have the opportunity to have the career as what best suits them, they will have an easier life and being more helpful to the people around them.

If FACS started being used in elementary school, proceeded to middle school, and so on in high school; it will teach students the habit of fully paying attention in class and being active. It will improve grades greatly. It will also help college students stay focused, even when times seem to become difficult. They will also already be influenced to stay active and fully aware of the lesson in class. If a student has well listening skills and is knowledgeable of their major, they will find the best job for theirself. If more people began to find jobs that benefitted them, and they were happy doing it, it would impact more than just students, it would impact the whole world.",0
"Boom! It's picture day and you can't decide which dress to wear! You pick out your two favorite dresses, and quickly ask your family members which one they enjoy best. Most of them agree that your pastel, lavender dress would best fit your spring pictures. When you take the pictures and get them back they look amazing! Due to the fact you asked multiple people for their opinion on your dress, you managed to get magnificent pictures. That is why I believe getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Doing so can help you improve on certain things like essays, help you make a difficult decision, and assist you from making bad decisions.

First of all, getting multiple opinions can help you on certain things like a math problem. Lets say the question was difficult and don't think you got the correct answer, so you ask others and see if they got a similar answer. If they don't you can see where you or maybe the other person went wrong and get a better grade! Another way it can help is letting other people read your essay. If you let multiple people read it, they might catch certain things you didn't see before. They might see things like spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. For example, I let my father, my step-mom, and friends read the stories I write to see if I made any mistakes.

Also, if you ask multiple peoples opinions it can can help you with a difficult decision. Going back to the example in the first paragraph, you didn't know what to wear for picture day. So, you asked your family their opinions on what to wear because you couldn't decide. With asking their opinion they helped you choose and prevented you from struggling. Also, you might be choosing a new backpack because your old backpack broke, so you go out to buy a new one but can't decide which one to choose. Instead of standing there for hours you ask your friends their opinion and now you have a brand new backpack you love. A personal example is I couldn't decide what jacket to wear, so instead of sitting there for hours I messaged my friends and asked for their opinion. Their opinion made me able to go out and enjoy my day sooner than sit there debating which jacket to use.

Lastly, it can help you from making a bad decision. If you don't know what clothes to wear in cold weather, you can ask others what clothing would best suit the weather. Their opinion helped you go outside in warm clothing than walking outside in clothing that is meant for warm days in below-freezing weather. Or maybe your sick but don't think your ill enough to cancel the days plans, so you ask others for their opinion and they all agree your much to sick to go out. For example, one day I didn't feel well but thought I wasn't feeling ill enough to stay home from school, but I asked my family and they agreed I was much too ill to go because I was running a 100.1 degree fever. Due to the fact I asked their opinion I prevented the possibility of getting others sick and spreading my illness.

Seeking multiple opinions can certainly help you make a better choice. It has helped me and many others do excellent on certain things, prevented us from embarrassment, and kept us from making a bad decision. I understand sometimes it can be hard to seek others opinions and may be a little scary, but I believe it can and will help you make a better choice.",0
"Limiting car usage would be an extraordinary improvement in everyone's daily lives. When you think of Bejing, China what do you see? Busy streets filled with cars, sky scrapers, and SMOG. The earth shouldn't be treated like this, when people excessively drive it creates significant amounts of greenhouse gases. Also, we shouldn't have to live in this kind of environment, filled with smog, it's very unhealthy to inhale these substances. Think about a world with no cars for a second like in Vauban, Germany walking to work which gets in a quick morning exercise, watching kids play with their friends outside, clear skies, oh and actually being able to take a deep breath without suffocating. These are all marvelous reasons to reduce car usage.

Think of Earth before cars there were clear skies, green views, blue seas, birds chirping in the morning. Nice right? Well, now come back to reality where the air is gray, the fields are covered with roads or dirt, the seas are filled with oil and the sea animals all fighting for their lives. According to experts, ""passengers are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in United States"". Is sitting in a car, being lazy, stuck in a traffic jam really worth this? You could be out enjoying the view taking it all in, getting in a few minutes of exercise even. To me, there is no question, I won't be responsible for the lives of others.

Now, jump forward a few years, imagine excessive car use, black skies, no room to walk. Who wants this kind of environment to live in? Noone, and thats why we need to change our lifestyles a tad, otherwise this is what it will be like. The smog that cars create is not good for you, it damages your lungs slowly, but surely. My question is would you rather save a few minutes getting to work and die a few years early, or walk to work, enjoying the beautiful view of nature and also getting some exercise in? I think this decision is the easiest one a person could make.

Lastly, think about the future generations, do you want them to be unhealthy and relying on automobiles their whole lives or do you want them to experience the awesome adventures life has? Don't use your car for one day, that's not too much to ask and just appreciate your neighbors, the animals and all the amazing things Earth has to offer. That will surely change your mind about using cars and if it doesn't have a nice life struggling to take a breath and see more than a few feet in front of you.

I definitely think that car usage has a major negative impact on our environment and it needs to change. Cars hurt our Earth, our health, and our daily lives distorting us from what we really need. Apparently, ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.."" this is an amazing start and I hope it continues.",0
"Many cities are experiencing perhaps the biggest economic change being implemented into society since the invention of the Model T. People just simply aren't interested in attaining a personal vehicle, or even a license for that matter. As a result, many personal vehicle companies are starting to become more ""mobile"" to stay with the times, or become bankrupt due to being stagnant in sales. Not owning a car has actually proved to come with more advantages than if owning a car. Such as, less carbon emissions in the air, less stress in certain communites where car-free zones are being implemented, and finally restaurants and stores becoming more ""cropped up"" due to rush-hour restrictions; essentially boosting the economy.

The lack of car use has fundamentally benefitted the environment as an entirety. Cars emit carbon emissions into the air that are not only harmful to many animals, but to humans as well. According to Source 2, in Paris, France alone, it was shown that ""due to the use of diesel fuel over regular fuel, there were 147 micrograms of particle matter per cubic meter."" Comparing this to other major cities in Europe that find more use for regular gasoline, you'll find that the results are less. In Brussels, there were 114 micrograms of PM per cubic meter, and in London, 79.7. Even though areas that used more regular fuel over diesel fuel were significantly lower in micrograms of particle matter, even 79.7 micrograms can be potentially fatal, and cause lung-related health problems in the later lives of the people occupying these areas. Officials not only in Paris, but also in major cities such as Bogota, Colombia and New York City, New York have also began to take a stand. In Paris, France for example, ""there are certain days in which cars cannot be driven by people with license plates ending in even numbers, and the next day by people with license plates ending in odd numbers. This new way of thinking has been implemented into the French law system to help decrease the amount of pollution in the air."" (Source 2) Bogota has also found a unique approach to a less polluted environment. ""Car-free day is a day in which no cars are driven, with the exception of buses and taxis."" (Source 3) Finally, New York City has implemented a ""new bike-sharing program in which bicycles can be rented for a cost-effective amount. In addition to this, bridge and tunnel tolls have also reflected these new priorities by skyrocketing in price."" (Source 4) These new implementations have proved beneficial in decreasing the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Many communities have not only found a way to reduce pollution in the air, but also live a more stress-free lifestyle.

Stress and rush-hour are known to have some corollation, but newer communites are starting to take a stand by limiting the amount of car usage in their area. Vauban, Germany, a newer community only just established in 2006, is an example of one of these communites that has started to ""smart plan."" Over 70 percent of Vauban's occupants don't own a car, and 57 percent have sold a car to move there."" (Source 1) A happier lifestyle has appeared as a result. According to Heidrun Walter, an occupant in Vauban. When she had a car, she was always ""tense."" But now, she's a much happier mother of two, and the distant hum of an occasional motor vehicle is drowned out by the ""chattering of wandering children."" (Source 1) In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is suggesting that we start implementing these ""car reduced"" communities in our nation to better society, as well as to provide a more stress-free environment for these new communites' residents. (Source 1) Even in Bogota, people have said that the use of no cars is a ""great opportunity that has taken away stress and lowered air pollution."" (Source 3)

Not only has pollution been reduced in all of this or the fact that a factor attributing to stress has also been removed, but areas where these communites are starting to form, have also boosted the economy. In Bogota, it has been reported that due to Car-free day, that both ""parks and sports centers have started to appear throughout the city. In additon to this, sidewalks have been replaced by more broad, smooth sidewalks. As well as, rush-hour traffic has been cut, allowing new restaurants and upscale shopping districts to flourish."" (Source 3) ""Cars are starting to become a thing of the past,"" according to Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Even her children (19 and 21) don't have licenses. ""They say they're interested, but it's not a priority for them,"" she later goes on to say. As a result, gas money is saved, and people can spend more money on things that matter to them.

In conclusion, it has been displayed that the advantages of not using a car are starting to outweight the benefits. The lack of car use in these car-free communities is helping to reduce stress and tension on the road, boost not only the community's economy, but also the entire nation's economy as well. In addition to this, the lack of car use is also helping to preserve the environment, by reducing carbon emissions into the air. According to many sociologists and business professionals, the downfall of the car may well be on its way, but it may not be such a bad thing.",0
"Cars may seem like a great new way to get around but have you ever actually done your research on a car and what they do to the world? You may want to do some reasearch on how cars are actaully not good of an idea to use on a daily basis. There are a lot of citys and towns that want to stop the daily use of cars. Cars may seem like a good idea and like some  people say ""yay I dont have to walk anymore"" but if you really knew what cars do then you wouldnt really like them anymore.

Cars produce so much pollution in the air, its sickening to know how much they reqally produce. Can you imagine how polluted new york city may be because of so many cars, busses, etc? I think thats why a lot of states are doing the train system, to stop so much pollution and to reduce the amount of cars we use. Like florida for example are starting the ""sunrail"" which is a train system that will take you all the way around town. Also look at this, so many ""smart"" cars are coming soon and electric cars where you charge your car and then you can just go drive and not get gas. They are actually making charging stations for electeric cars now.

If you start to limit your car use and start using a bus, train, etc you are also saving so much money on gas. like the amount of money you save on gas you can be buying yourself those shoes you wanted or that game youve been wanting to bad. The world is filled with so much pollution and nasty chemicals in the air and some of that is because of your car.. trucks also have so much pollution that its just sickening. Wouldnt it be great if your kids and your grandkids wont have to use a car and they will actaully probably live longer because there isnt as many chemicals in the skies. We may be living longer then the people back then but they didnt have cars so they didnt have any issues with pollution.

Car accidents, thats the most dreaded word ever. I dont think anyone wants to get a phone call saying someone you love or care about has been in a car accident. Thats the worst possible thing. You rarely see accidents with trains, or busses. I think its such a great idea to lower our use of cars and start using other ways to get arond. Most of us have 2 legs we should actually use them sometime and not be lazy and always want to drive places. People back then didnt have that option they either walked or didnt go anywhere at all. So we should lower/stop our use of cars.",0
"In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the pursuit despite the danger the author include that thar are almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide is on venus and the temperes average over 800 dergrees fahrenheit. NASA is telling us like how it not liveabul on venus. venus has the hottest suface temperature of any plantet in our solar system. NASA has been sening thing to Venus but the hostile conditions on the surface of venus is bad so NASA idea for sending thing to venus is having vehicl hovering 30 or so mile above the roiling landscape. having vehicl hovering over the landscape of venus.

The text also state even a vehicl will have so much time to hovering over venus because the light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere. More importantly resher can't take anything because it is dense atmosphere. Fot them to seeking any info thay would have to get up close and personal despite the risks.

"Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite.

To start this off, if our president was decided by a popular vote, our president might not be the best thing for our country. As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states."" As you know, tossup state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group Democratic or Republic. Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the candidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place.

Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might simply win because he or she is a regional favorite. As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take rodney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. rodney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winnertakeall"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president.

Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the candidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.

In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man or woman might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.",0
"In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"", we are faced with another difficult task. We have had many hard task in our past space wise, from our first step on the moon, to the discovery of Pluto being a dwarf planet. Studying Venus closely is a worthy pursuit because, it's a challenge and who doesn't like a challenge, it would be a exploration many people from generations old and new would like rake on themselves, and possibly we could find a way to live on a planet other than Earth.

Exploring Venus is going to be extremely challenging. For example, the passage says ""Venus has the hottest surfqace temperature of any planet in our solar system."" This place is going to to be extremely hard to get close to because of the heat. We can't even take pictures because ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the atmosphere."" Our most high-tech cameras can't even get a decent picture of the surface of Venus.

Many people from the new and old generation are obbssed with space and everything to do with it. Our workers at NASA have created electronics that have been designed to last on Venus and they have survived weels in the harsh terrain. NASA is constantly discovering something new about space. They are even using designs from the past like our ""mechnical computers."" They are using the design of mechanical computers because the are very durabole under harsh conditions, which is what we're gonna need in order to explore Venus.

The planet Venus is very much like Earth. There are so many energy resources there. ""Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" That is great because if we lived on Venus we wouldn't have to worry about pollutting the planets as quickly as we have done on Earth. Also, we would be able to spread the electricity widely throughout the palnet.

In conclusion, exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit for many reasons. We are going to get there one day with the way our space administrations are working. There is so much we don't know about the planets in our solar system, even our own planet. We should take the opportunity to explore whatever we can as soon as we can. That way we won't go extintic like many thing in our world.",0
"My prompt is about how everyone has a skill or talent and I have to identify a talent or skill that I have and explain how I develop and use it. Well I'm an Athletic girl. I play different sports during some seasons, for example when soccer season has ended. Another sport I'm kinda good at is basketball. I play sports in school and outside of school. A few other things I can do is sing and dance.

I'm going to start with soccer. So I started playing soccer in 2018. I dont really remember my age but I do remember the year. When I started playing soccer was when I lived in Generic_City. I played there for to seasons. I played in the spring and fall seasons. When I played in the spring it was the best thing ever like I'm telling you I literally fell in love with soccer at that time. My team was a good team we were called the sharks. I was number 14 and I was happy because that's the number that both of my cousins jersey numbers are. Anyways, we won a few games and lost a few ones but we always played good, we gave our best, and we gave it all. After, spring season ended I played on the fall season. I'm going to say that fall season was okay it wasn't as good as spring season but I still enjoyed it. My jersey number changed in that season so then I was number 16. I haven't played since 2019 ended but I will start playing again pretty soon and I'm really happy and excited.

Now I'm going to talk about my basketball season. Last year in 7th grade I was in Generic_School and they put up the girls basketball season was coming. I was interested in it so I decided to sign up and try-out for the team. I can't lie try-outs were rough but at the end of the day I gave my best and it was fun. A few weeks later they put up the paper of the people who made it and I saw my name and I was so happy. Anyways, that season ended, then school ended, and I moved to Generic_City. School started a few months later girls basketball season started. I was happy so I sign up. I went to try-outs for the whole week. At the end of Friday which was the last day of try-outs the coach Generic_Name told the girls who made the team and who didn't and guess who made the team MEE!!!!. I was so happy my friends and I celebrated on the way out. The whole season was great, I made so many fun memories with the girls and I was just so happy.

My third skill is dancing. I love to dance everyday. Like I'm always dancing in the car, shower, kitchen, my room, just everywhere. I love it and I enjoy it very much. It's something that could never leave me. Im going to start taking dancing classes so I'm very excited for that. One app that I always use to dance is Dubsmash it has different song that I can dance to. I'm always dancing to a song in the car when a song comes up and it has beats I just be going crazy.

Finally, the last thing I love to do is sing. Singing for me is just very enjoyable and calming. I sometimes get on my feelings and cry but it's just because they are really good songs and I cry because I'm happy or sad. I love to sing the songs of Sydney R. But my top favorite songs to sing are All of Me, Into you, Love don't Change, and How you gonna. And yeah these are all the stuff that I do as a skill or talent. ",0
"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identfy the many emotions of humans. This was designed to improve the accuracy in perceiving emotions of people around you. This system gives better opportunities for humans and computers to communicate. By moving the muscles in your face, it creates a facial expression, which is then compared to a face that is showing no emotion. This system would be valuable in a classroom because it help teachers relate to students and how they can improve their teaching to make things more fun and understandable, as well as recognizing personal situations.

The Facial Action Coding System helps teachers relate to their students by knowing how they feel about a lesson and how the teacher explains it. The texts states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student it becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor.'"" Knowing how a student feels can help a teacher immensely. This can show what activities and tactics help students most and some things that do not help at all. This could result in the improvement of grades and understanding of what is being taught.

The Facial Action Coding System can also help with the personal life that may be brought into a classroom. If someone is being bullied or is having problems at home, this may be a way for it to be recognized if the person is afraid to say anything. According to the text, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang."" This gives teachers and adults ability to recognize and resolve issues that may not have been known about before.

Many students everywhere tend to hide their emotions and thoughts because they are afraid of consequences, whether it is mentally, physically, or emotionally. The Facial Action Coding System can help in ways people can't just by asking someone how they feel. This program can be used to help people in need whether it is relating to learning skills or regarding personal problems taking place at home or school. This gives opportunites to help in many situations and would be very effective in schools.",0
"The electoral college is a time worn system. Some people hate it, others defend it to their dying breath. The electoral college is no longer a good way to select our nations' leader because the power no longer rests with the people.

Through the electoral college system, we put our votes into the trust of strangers who may or may not decide to vote how they want and completely disregard our voices. Plus with all of the corruption in government as it is, it wouldn't be the most difficult thing to buy a voter off and potentially change the outcome of the election. Or the electoral college voters could end up clueless or untrustworthy, as Bradford Plumer, Source 2, paragraph 10, points out: ""Can voters always control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."", proving the point that the people are not in control.

Granted there are a few small benefits to the electoral college. It usually prevents the confusion of ties inside states, and, as Source 3, paragraph 20, Richard A. Posner says, "" Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" The problem with the overwhelming power given to the swing states by the electoral college is that it does not represent the American idea: that no one group of people is in control, that everybody has an equal say in the matter. When a state like California votes for a candidate, that candidate immediately has an advantage from the start. And all the people in California who voted for the other candidate are not heard at all.

Corruption is, again, a major problem with most politics, including the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists nearly replaced all of the democratic electoral voters in Louisiana with voters who would instead oppose John F. Kennedy, and potentially cost him the election. But while a small group of people can be bought off and turned to vote against the majority, it is impossible to corrupt the American people. It would also cause candidates to have to pay more attention to the smaller states and the states that the candidate thinks they will win over automatically due to their current party.

The American people need the power to elect their leader back in their hands again. The electoral college was a good system years ago, but with time comes change.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", paragraph 1 states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". It has features similar to earth such as mountains, valleys, and craters. The author says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans, and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Since Venus is similar to Earth, It has caught the attention of many Astronomers.

Despite its dangers such as the extreme temperatures, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth, it is worthy of being studied.

NASA has came up with ideas to exploring the planet. One of the ideas is to ""allow scientists to float above th fray"" as stated in paragraph 5. Hovering 30 miles above the landscape, there are problems that come with that.

When floating, the temperatures would still be hot, being around 170 degrees Farenheit. The pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth"". Solar power wouldn't be a problem and radiation would not exceed Earth's levels. Although the planet is not in the best condition, it's survivable for humans. There would be problems trying to explore Venus since the scientists would be floating high above the surface. The author states, ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance"". In order to explore the planet to the fullest, the only option would be to get up close and personal.

Since modern day technology is delicate, a different type of technology would have to be able to withstand Venus's conditions. A cell phone, tablet or anything related to that sort of technology wouldn't be the greatest considering it is easy to break. NASA has came up with the idea of using mechanical computers. These computers make calculations by using gears and levers and don't require any electronics. It has stronger material and is more likely to survive the conditions of Venus. The passage says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of immagination and innovation"". To me this proves that Venus is worth exploring.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. These examples include, less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. There is less stress because you are always tense as stated in the first source. There's cleaner air because cars are one of the leading causes to air pollution as said in source two. There's also more safety because streets don't have as much traffic stated on source three and four.

One benefit of limiting car usage is that there is less stress. There is less stress because when you own a car you may find yourself tense a lot of the time or maybe all of the time. In source one, Hedrium Walter stated that she was always tense with a car and now she is much happier. Bike riding and walking outside can be relieving without the sound of motors, hearing the children play in the park and breathing the fresh air is much better. In source three Carlos Arturo Plaza said that car free day is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This is another instance of someone supporting limiting car usage because there is less stress.

Cleaner air is another benefit to limiting car usage. Cars are one of the leading factors to air pollution, this is shown in source two. In source two, it states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France afer fivedays of intensifying smog. This proves that limiting car usage provides cleaner air for the environment. With cleaner air, there is a healthier population which is a benefit to limiting the usage of vehicles.

There is more safety with limiting car usage. If car usage is limited, then there aren't as many car accidents and there is less traffic. Less traffic could also lead to public transportation becoming more efficient and faster. The bus would be able to get to places much faster without other cars being in the way with would be a benefit to limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage would be for the better of the population. It would cause less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. The usage of cars should be limited for the better of man and it should happen everywhere.",0
"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is widely acknowledged for serves a purpose as a method of selecting a president and vice president, not a legitimate college. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between having the President elected by a vote in Congress and an election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This process of choosing a president needs to be modified into popular vote for the reasons that the Electoral College was established to actually vote a slate of electors, voters feel disenfranchised, and is unfair to voters.

To begin with, the Electoral College was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. Stated in ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, "" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" This means that under this system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors who then elect the president. The voters sometimes aren't told full front that they are chosing someone else and not always can they control who their electors are voting, leaving many puzzled. Voters aren't to be puzzled. They are to vote who they'd like because it allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly acknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.

In addition, the Electoral College makes voters feel discouraged and disenfranchised. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, it is stated, "" No region...has enough electoral votes to lect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" This means that voters feel that the president they chose is their president because they believe their votes count.

furthermore, the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because the candidates they ""vote"" for don't spend time with them. Sizes matter to the candidates. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, it is stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates do't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" This quote conveys that because some states are small in population and size, they will not help the candidate succeed. This is immensely discouraging to the voters because they feel worthless for not being big in size. Candidates should not have an excuse to not thank all their voters because every vote counts, not matter how small.

Admittedly, the Electoral College allows a clear and certain outcome because it exceeds the popular vote, however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. The popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the popular president.

In the final analysis, a change is needed because with the Electoral College many candidates are losing potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they arn't doing much by voting considering they aren't voting for the president, but a gamut of electors to vote for them. They alos express the feeling of discontent and unfairness because they feel that they don't count and know they have no chance at winning.",0
"""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Heidrun Walter source 1. For many years, people have depended on cars to take them places and allow them to live a normal life. However, the recent decline in driving and car sales has proven that there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage would help reduce the greenhouse effect, would help reduce smog and other lowair pollution, as well as helping promote aspects of the eeconomy which differ from purely car sales and transportation.

To begin with, the greenhouse effect, a large part of which is caused by cars and their emissions, is endangering not only our environments and ecosystems, but also life as we know it. According to source 1 In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, passengers car are the cause of 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and also responsible for approximately 50% of emissions in certain parts of the US. Setting restrictions would allow for a decline in emission of greenhouse gases, which in turn would better life on Earth. Its effects could be seen all over the world, such as in global warming, rising oceans, etc. Therefore, limiting car usage would have a positive effect, because it would reduce the emission greenhouse gases.

Equally important, the presence of smog, pollutioncaused fog, and lowair pollution is also endangering the wellbeing of humans and other species health, as well as the wellbeing of the Earth, so to speak. According to source 2 Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""After Days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" after setting restrictions for five days, Paris saw an improvement in air quality. We can thus infer that setting restrictions regularly would help reduce the pollution and general smog of the area. Placing restrictions would help promote various means of transportation, such as public transportation, bikes, walking, etc. An example would be the one from source 3 Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota in this case, a day during which a capital city places restrictions of the use of cars, helps build a campaign, which allows for bike paths, parks, and sport centers to be created and for sidewalks to be repaired. It has also led to restrictions to regulate rushhour traffic. Clearly, reducing and limiting car usage can not only reduce smog and lowair pollution, but can also help create a more active city.

Finally, limiting car usage may promote different aspects of the eeconomy. According to source 1, the transportation bills in the US budget have, in the past, been used, for the most part, for highways. Reducing car usage may allow for certain parts of the US budget to be used for more important and diverse things, such as education, government funding, community life, and many more. Also, limitations on car usage could help conserve resources, allowing people to place their money into different aspects of their lives, like it is explained in source 4. Moreover, the less people can use their cars, the less people will buy cars source 4: ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license"". This will help people focus on rebuilding the economy. Obviously, there are economic advantages to limiting car usage, such as availability for flexibility in the government budget, conserving money, and the rebuilding of the eeconomy.

To conclude, there are various advantages to limiting car usage limitations may help improve the eeconomy, will help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and will help reduce the lowair pollution and smog often found in largely populated areas.",0
"I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.

Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and

Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.

There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.

If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",0
"To start this off it would be a great idea to study venus because it's some much different then earth. When looking at it from earth soemthimes it called Evening stars. Which is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky.

Venus is alot different but at the same time alot alike. Venus is like earths twin its closest planet to earth in desity and size. Sometimes we arent as close to venus as we can be to mar. Mars, Earth, and Venus go around the sun at differsnt speed even though they are close to one an another.

To conclude these two planets are very close but canbe very different. Earth has two planet that arent alike and different then it. Mars and venus, but these three can be really similar but very different in many ways. We have life here on Earth but mars and venus do not that we know of.",0
"Would'nt it feel amazing to walk down the sidewalks to go some where and know that you are helping save our planets ozone layer. Well you would be! Limmiting car usage is starting to become the next big focus and some people have found some benifical advantages to the limit of car usage. It would reduce the emission of green house gases greatly. Businesses would see a tremedious profit because of people walking. Although, some people would'nt like this at all because it would take more time to get to one place, they still could car pool or even get some exersice by walking or riding a bike.

Green house gags has become a huge concern because it is destroying our atmosphere! In source 1, Elisabeth Rosental explains that passenger cars make up 50 percent of the green house gags in the United States and that just the cars! If we would limit our usage of car then we could reduce margin so muh all we have to do is find a more efficent way of transportation. In source 3, Andrew Selsky write about how Bogtoa had a car free day and Carlos Arturo says ""it was a good opportunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution."" So not only would we be helping save our atmosphere but we would be saving ourselves from stress of diving.

Businesses strive on bring in customes so they can make profit. If we would reduce the the usage of cars then customers wouldnt be problem for business men because people would be walking or riding bike and usally will stop for something to eat or even stop to look inside a shop while on there way to their destination. It would help the communites economy boost.

Some people might disagree on the idea of tring to cut the car usage rate because it will take a longer time to get some where. However, they could still car pool or even ride a bike and get some exerscie. Also, reducing car usage would help people become more social in their life. They could meet new people and get to know some one if they would ride the public bus. In source 4, Elisabet Rosenthal explains how accients from cars are a mjor cause of death but its so unsafe when you get out on the road. Reducing car usage has many advantages for our live to stress free and safe.

Deminishing car usages has many positive changes to our lives and to our planet. for exapmle, with less cars we would have less pollution being emitted into the air which i killing the atmosphere as we speak, people would be happier with less cars because they dont have to stress over driving and paying full attention on the road and conditions. Less cars would have a more social effect on the live of humans. The positive advantages on reducing car usage are endless!",0
"The Face on Mars The Landform

Do you belive the Face on Mars is made by aliens? The Face on Mars is a landmass on planet Cydonia or Mars. I beleive that the face is just a natural land form.

The face was found around the 1990s by a ship named the Viking 1 in shearch for a possible landing sites for its sister ship the Viking 2. The face is about 2miles from end to end. A few days after scientists figured it was another Martian mesa NASA reveiled the photos to try to atract public atentin to Mars.

People got the wrong idea about the face they thought that the face was a ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. the face was everywhere it appeared in a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows,and even haunted grocery stores. In September 1997 the Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program sent a [MGS] Mars Global Surveyor to take a pictuer of the face.

As I said befor I belive the face is just a landform on Mars. the mesa or butte forms on Earth to but Mars' land formations are larger that of Earth's in conclusen i hope this essay helped you see that the face is probaly just a landmark.",0
"Voting for president should be fair and democratic to all the people. Decisions for the country that affect the people should ultimately be determined by them since their lives could be greatly impacted by those decisions. Today, the country determines the election of the president of the United States by using the electoral college. Although the electoral college is effective in many ways, does it really portray what the people want? Changing the election to election by popular vote would determine what the people want in a more democratic and fair way. The United States was built upon democracy and that strong profile should be kept.

The electoral college is a process by which voters vote for electors that elect the president determined by their political party. In theory it may seem like an effective process, but it can bring many problems. Source 2 says that the single best argument we have against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election crisis of 2000 was because of the electoral college process and that even worse things could have happened. The electoral college has brought a lot of problems. ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" Source 2. Electors refusing to vote for their party's candidate, or refusing to vote altogether could lead to things like Hawaii sending two slates of electors to Congress in 1960. The electoral college system leads to a lot of complications and using popular vote would make the process simpler.

Voting by the electoral college can bring unfairness to the voting process. Source 3 explains that when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Your votes do not directly go to the president you want, so even if a president wins the popular vote, they could still lose the electoral college vote and the election all together. ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538is an even number, but it is highly unlikely....,"" Source 3. Voting by popular vote would not allow this to happen because of the amount of people voting and the likelihood of that happening is even less. Also, the fairness of small states and big states is not democratic in the electoral college process. Since larger states have a greater population, they tend to get more attention than smaller states do. There would clearly be more equality in voting by popular vote than in the electoral college.

""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a poplular vote of qualified citizens,"" Source 1. Although this compromise was good in theory at the time, the process is not very fair and does not bring the right people to be elected as electors. The electors are chosen depending on how they reach certain criteria by the law. These laws vary though, which could bring a wide variety of people from each state. This would give some states the upper hand compared to others. There would be no worry about the certain people chosen as electors in the process of popular vote.

The electoral college brings complications, unfairness, and the worry of chosing electors from each state. The Untited States was built upon the idea of general democracy and the process of the electoral college does not carry out that idea. Chosing the president by popular vote would give the people a more democratic way of chosing whom they want to be in charge of the country. The people of the country are the ones most impacted by decisions of the country, so they should have more of a say in what is decided.",0
"Cars will always be one of the greatest inventions of all time, among the wheel and electricity, but they have some terrible side affects. Cars are one of the leading causes of pollution in the world. They are also very expensive to own and operate. By limiting car usage, you could cut down and costs and protect the environment.

By not using cars, it could drastically improve the environment. In Paris they banned driving because of smog, and now they have no smog and a much cleaner city. If driving limits were placed everywhere, then this could happen worldwide.

Everyone knows that cars are very expensive, to buy one knew can set you back tens of thousands of dollars. And then a few years down the road it breaks down, to fix it can costs you thousands. Not to mention inssurance and gas. Just imagine how much money you could have if you didnt ever have a car. You could practically buy a house with the savings. That could happen to everyone if we limited the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use such as saving the environment and saving money. We need to follow Paris's example and cut out car usage in cities to create a healthier world.",0
"Dear, Florida Senators

I believe that the Electoral College is a good way of voting for a President and Vice President because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by  a single vote in Congress. The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors is the meeting where the electors vote for there President and Vice President. Plus the majority of the 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President of the United States. The United States entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One each of the memebers in the House of Representives plus two of your Senators. In our state, each citizens have there own group of voters that vote for a President and Vice President of there chose. Some even vote for candidates that are going for a person running for President or Vice President. Our state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. '

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If I lived in Texas, for example, and wanted to vote for [Adam] Pis , I'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Pis. On the note, that those electors won the statewide election, they would goto congress and Pis would get 34 electoral votes. There are a lot of questions that people ask, who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state that some citizens are living in because some states can have picked electors and some dont even pick electors so, it must depends what state the citizen lives in.

Perhaps worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Its hard to think about this but some are right, abolish the electoral college!

"I believe that the electoral college is an outdated system of voting, and that we should get rid of it. If we removed the electoral college, votes could be counted much quicker, and more accurately. Our system now is outdated, and needs to be replaced with something different.

The electoral college was established in a time where technology was very primitive, and votes had to be taken as a general consensus, because counting hundreds of thousands of votes would take a large amount of time and was impractical. In current time though, counting single votes is much faster and accurate than going through the process of the electoral college. A large poll could be taken that digitally stores the votes of citizens quickly and safely. The electoral college is not very accurate either. For example, as stated in source 2, Al Gore won the popular vote, but loss due to the way that the electoral college works. Many citizens feel as if their vote doesn't matter, because they aren't directly voting for a candidate, they're voting for electors that will vote for a candidate.

The thought that in a democracy, that the voting system that we use to pick our ""leader"" is a winnertakeall ideology is absurd. If we are to keep the electoral college, we must change the way that the electoral vote system works. We must change it so that it is no longer winnertakeall, and make it so that a certain percentage of votes goes the party that the vote is for. For example, if 50% of people voted for rodney, and 50% voted for Obama, we should split the electoral votes right down the middle, so that the amount of electoral votes a candidate gets reflects their popular vote. Many presidents focus on larger states, which is understandable due to the fact that they have more votes, but if we change the way that the votes work, the candidate that focuses on many smaller states can stand a chance in the election.

So as you can see, if we want our future presidents to be elected fairly, our voting system must change. Whether it is completely taking away the electoral college, or just changing the way that electoral votes are counted, there must be a change. I don't think that you want to see the candidate that you voted for to lose as Al Gore did back in 2000.",0
"Some people think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, which is anaccurate. Mars obviously has alot of natural disasters on its planet almost daily. These natural disasters could've made the surface into a face like shape by how much damage was caused to the enviroment. Mars is full of red bolders that could of been tossed around by the storms and left marks or craters in the surface. I have a little more detail to my theory.

First, there is no sign of alien life on Mars. I'm not saying there's no sign of life on Mars period, there is sign of water being on that planet and possibaly plants as well. It's just that there is no sign of a species on that planet, not even fossils of the so called ""aliens"". If there was any aliens on Mars what material would they have to make any form in the ground. Aliens probably wont have any exsplosives on their planet with no material to make it with.

Next, if there were any aliens why would they make a face on the ground. It has no meaning to it, it might just be a ruler/king or something to their people. I dont think aliens would want to put a face on the ground that barely looks like a face. The enviroment made the form because the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho was made by our enviroment, so it can be a caquensadence. That's a compairason that leads me to believe the enviroment of Mars made that face on the surface.

Then, there are scientific facts and quotes from NASA that supports lots of evidence. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter revealed that the Face was a natural landform. And added that ""there was no alien monument after all."". The team snapped ten photos of the lanform that was sharper then the first camera of Viking 1. This team gives more evidence than the conspiracy theories by the public.

In conclusion, I think that my theory is both accurate and logical. I took edvice from people who did their research on this topic. The evidence that i took were both believable and not crazy theories from ordinary citizens. These are my reasonings on why i think that the Face was made by Mars enviroment.",0
"There is a lot of discussion whether or not to keep the Electoral College. The electoral college is the process in which we vote for our next president. It was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers, which was a really long time ago. So why do we still use the Electoral College? The Electoral College is completely outdated. We need to get rid of the Electoral College now!

Why are we still using the Electoral College to vote? It's extremely confusing. What if you vote for the wrong elector? That sometimes happens which is unfair to voters. We should be able to just directly vote for the president we want. If we could just vote for the president we want, not the electors, it would be so much simpler. Why confuse the citizens of the U.S. when you could just make things easier for us? The Electoral College is a way to confusing process to vote for our president. It's time to update the way we vote.

People think they're voting for the president, but really, they're just voting for electors. That is completely unfair. Why not just vote for the president of your choice? The citizens cannot always control who the electors vote for. How unfair would that be if the elector you chose, decided to vote for the president you didn't want? Also, the electors can be just anyone. They can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on what state you're in, either the state conventions, the states party central committee or even the presidential candidates can pick the electors. Why even bother going through all that trouble when you could just vote for the president you want? It's way more easier.

There are so many things that could go wrong when using the Electoral College process to vote. What if there is a tie in the electoral votes? Then who does the state choose? That would throw everyone off guard. Why have to even worry about that when you could just vote the president of your choice? It's ridiculous that we still use the Electoral College to vote. Also, we could choose the wrong elector when voting and that would really make people mad.

The Electoral College is outdated, confusing, and just way to complicated. Why go through the trouble of having to make sure you vote for the right elector, when you could just vote for the president of your choice. It's completely irrational how we still use the Electoral College to vote. You're not voting for the president you want, but for electors to choose the president. You can't always control who the electors vote for. There are a handful of things that could go wrong. We just need to get rid of the Electoral College once and for all.",0
"Dear Senator,

I favoring of keeping the Electoral College because it aviods run-off elections and the certainy of outcome .If it aviods run-off elections then no canidate can get the most votes in a vote cast. According to the article Does the Electoral College work source three states, Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurity or the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College(301 and 307 electoral votes respectively).The electoral college is important because it can do certainty of the outcome . It's important that it has it so that it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. According to the article Does the Electoral College worksource three states,In the 2012 election,for example Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elcetoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney.I also what to keep the Electoral College so that nothing goes wrong if it gets changed. For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it. Also if theres no Electoral College then they wouldn't be any electors to select from and no counting of the electoral votes by congress. In conclusion to,I favor in keeping the Electoral College instead of changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.",0
"Dear Florida Sentator,

It is in the interest of your state and your nation that you insist the keeping of the Electoral College system of voting. This is overwhelmingly clear because it allows the presidental canidates to focus on the country as a whole in their campaign trail instead of relying on a single region to win the presidency for them, it has been present in this nation  since out founding fathers, and the system also shows a clear winner in the end of the election.

In order for the presidental canidate to have a reasonable chance at winning the presidency, he or she has to appeal to the country as a whole instead of just focusing on a particular region. This is all due to the Electoral College. A canidate who is practically assured to win in a region, such as the Northeast, would not campaign as much in those states. The article

In Defense of the Electoral College highlights that if that canidate were to becaome president of the United States, ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" Just think about that. Imagine having a president who got elected just because he won over the South. It would be as if he or she had only that region's interests at heart and did not care for the rest of the nation. The Presidnet is suppose to be the leader for the whole nation, not just a section of it. If this were to happen,the nation would be fractured, all because we got rid of the Electoral College. Some might argue that that probabably would never happen, and it might not, but we always have to keep in mind the worse scenarios to ensure the best decisions for the United States.

The Electoral College is arguably an old method of voting. It was established by our founding fathers and has been quite realiable over the couple hundred years it has been in service. Admittably, there have been a few blips in the system, but what system doesnt have kinks that need to be rolled out once and a while? It was intended to be ""...a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" as explained in

What is the Electoral College?

Why should this system be outed because of a fleeting feeling of anachronism? The intention of this system is meant to give equal votes to both the people and Congress.

The Electoral College system of voting has been under scrutiny lately. It has been a controversial issue. The system has had its share fo faults, but no more than a new system of voting would have. The Electoral College has served its country well and has given voices to the small states, given canidates a broader spectrum on their campaign trail, has been around for over 200 years, and shows a clear winner when all the votes are counted. Don't listen to the people telling you to stop the Electoral system Senator, because it is a valuable part of out nation.",0
"Im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea. First the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.

Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too.

In conclusion the technology to read peoples facial expressions is a great idea because the computer could help students out if they dont understand the work just by reading there faces.",0
"Many people such as  me have found that what is the purpose for a car when it emits gasses or does other things that people have such as smog many for some this is why they are trying to limit there use. But it does have it advantges though. Many countries have found out that limiting car usage was a great idea to do. And that is what I am going to explain to you.

People who live in Vauban, Germany in this upscale comunities are living without a car they say that the neighborhood is ""car-free"" many people in stead of driving a car they either ride a bike, walk, or thay have a car but they have to buy a space in a large garage on the outside of the comunity. And they also say that is is quiet and peacful you will hear an occasional distan moter but is drowned out with people talking bikes got past or even kids in the neighborhood.

Like many other contries they have to deal with smog fron the green house gasses for cars most areas are is 50% green house gas. But like other contries they have cars banned like in europe they fine people 22 euros ($31) some even had their car impounded for there reaction. Europe mostly blames deisel fuel because most of all the cars in europe are deisel.

People who live in Bogota, Colombia they have a day where they can't use their cars it is called car-free day millions have hiked, biked, skated or take the bus to work during this day. This is the thrid year that they have done this there are over 7 million people live there and participate to reduce smog but some don't do this and the violaters are fined $25. And they haven't stopped this even when the weather is terrible such a heavy rain but people just ignore it.

That was my explanation on how people feel about limiting the use of cars wether it is car-free day in columbia fining people in europe or just have your car somewhere else like the neighborhood in Vauban, Germany people who try to limit their use of there cars ussaly follow this.",0

Likewise, individuals without their cell phone feel sheltered because they can drive utilizing two hands. Also, they use contentions that cellphones are fundamental in crisis circumstances. Although a few people defend utilizing mobile phones while driving, there are confirmations that they're risky and individuals ought to abstain from talking on phones while driving.

Due to the discussion, they may get steamed and this can bring down their driving capacity which can prompt them to lose authority over the vehicle. So if individuals don't settle on a choice to secure their mobile phones, their routine can hurt honest individuals.

In any case, headphones don't dispose of the danger of causing a mishap. Several people demonstrate that utilizing headphones can be as perilous as holding a telephone on the grounds that the discussions diverts drivers from concentrating out and about. Researchers had demonstrated that individuals talking via telephone picture the person who they're conversing with and that doesn't meddle with driving. The issue is the point at which a vehicle swerves surprisingly or walker venture into traffic, and the mind does not have the preparing capacity to respond in time. So the issue isn't in holding the haggle telephone in the meantime what may cause a mishap on account of a needed maneuver, it is a result of discussion and absence of response at the critical moment.

In this manner, these days PDAs are pointless gadgets since they are problematic in crisis circumstances while On Star is dependable and ready to help you in an accident.

"I think it's good to know people's opinion because it can help you deside on something you wanna do. Maybe that person has already tried the thing you wanna try he can give you his opinion on the item. If you wanna buy something first it's good to talk to someone who has bought the item they can tell you if it works or not. Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesn't work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car. Or if you wanna buy some medicen you have to ask first before you drink the medicen or else you can even die from it if it's bad for you.

And you have to talk to more then just one person to be sure because if you don't you can waste you money just like that. And you always have to be positive when people give you advice even you know they aren't saying things right they are just trying to help you. It's always good to give your opinion on things because maybe they aren't sure if they wanna buy the item or not.

Giving advice is a way to be nice because you wanna prevent from that person to buy that item if they buy it and it doesn't work they are just going to waste money on the item.

Also by giving advice you can prevent people from getting hurt like if a guy walks to a store and buys something and it doesn't work he is going to come back to the store and fight the guy the sold him the item and then they both go to jail from fighting.

"I don't agree with using this technology to read students emotional expression. I think it wouldnt be a machines business to know how your feeling because some people like muself sometimes dont want to know how you really feel. For example. if I was feeling down one day about my dog passing away, and my little sisters want me to take them to the park. Im gonna stay as positive and happy as possible so it doesnt ruin their day. I would take them to the park making it seem like im happy, then eventually be happy myself after the fun we have. I wouldnt want some machine telling me or other people my emotions because thats my business.

Our emotions belong to us only and we choose for people or other things to know how we feel when we want to.

I am not the only one who sometimes hides the way they feel for a bit. We all know if you try to stay positive and have a good day that you will get over no matter what the situation is bringing you down. If you stay positive and happy, then it will all go away eventually instead of expressing how you feel and staying depressed or crying all day.

It seems like this technology can be useful or pretty cool to use on histroical people. Like who wouldnt want to know how Abe Lincon felt when he took his picture to be on the dollar bill. That would interest me by alot. Only because that is history and its very intersting, but using it everyday of your life can be really annoying and show less privacy. It is a good way to cheer people up like if a friend was feeling down and didnt want to tell you how he or she felt at the moment. That is understandable, but like i explained all you have to do is asume that they are feeling down and cheer them up the best you can and carry on with the day. Eventually they will be back to they're old self again.

Knowing how someone feels right off the top can be annoying for some people like myself. It can cause others like myself to feel very uncomfortable and not wanting to express how they feel because some machine does it for you. Maybe some people want to express how he or she felt a few days after they felt down or depressed. I highly disagree with thus technology being used in our everyday lives to see how we feel, although it would be very nice and interesting to use this technolgy on histroical pictures like the famous Mona Lisa or how President Abe Lincon felt on the dollar bill photo.",0
"Making Mona Lisa smile people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. The new software has developed that improves accury in the perceiving the emotins of others.

I agree with what they are making for new software that recognize emotions. We can actully calcute emotions like math. To recognize the subtle fical movement because we humans use to express how we feel. The mojor for the process is to know how you can track these facial movement. This can help you to understand that emotion is rate of how your feeling are. This mean That you can hide your feeling from your friends but how your phisical can show how by the look on your face that you are happy ,sad or worried of something.

Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatony to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. Thia means that da Vinci helped people to paint different look of emotion and feeling on the paint that they had made. The new software store simlar to rate the informations. To bring smile to your fae, while it's show just how much this computer can do. This mean the image on computer can make you happy,sad,smile and anger.

So I told him and he was very angry with me because of that situation, we ended up breaking up that day but i told my friend about it and she told me i shouldn't have told him and I felt as if I should. So I went to another friend of mine and she told me, I was right for telling him because if I didn't then I wouldn't be being honest with him or with myself. That day taught me that more then one view on a subject doesnt hurt.

Another reason, people should take advice from others is because they would handle it more differently. On day, I was sitting on my bed thinking about how I wanna fight this one girl, She messed with me everyday and I just wanted to show her who's boss. So the next day, I came to school all ready to beat her up. I wanted to get advice from one of my friends and she said before you go over there think about how much attention your attracting to yourself I said your right I will calmly go over there. I thought to myself it it really worth fighting this girl in my head my mind was saying yes do it but my heart was telling me no dont do it its not worth it. So 5 listened to my heart and I sat back down. That day I was thankful for my friends for having my back and not telling me to fight her.

Finally , people should take advice from others is because their idea could be more diverse than yours. I went to the park one day because i needed to left off some steam. So I facetimed my friend to tell her that I wanted to confront this girl about talking about people behind their back and she continued to tell me about how I should confront her about her shenanigans because it was getting out of hand at this point. I told somebody else about it and they told me to confront her but don't make a scene about it. So the next day I did that and surprisingly it went well, she did apologize to the people she bullied and now they are all friends. All of this tied up to say im so glad i have people who give great advice

In conclusion, people who take advuce from others are brave because sometime I dont even have the courage to talk to some people about what i'm going through, People should take advice from others beacuse you will have a better outcome, they will handle it differently, and their idea could be more diverse than yours",0
"How many opinions do you need before you can make a decision? Well, I know that for me personally I ask many people their opinions about my situation and about what actions I should take before my final decision is made. That's just how most people are, they ask many people, they get many opinions, and then they decide which they think is best. However, most people probably don't know why they seek multiple opinions instead of just asking one person. So today I'm going to tell you why you shouldn't just ask one person's opinion because it's so much better to get multiple opinions from multiple different people. Asking many people for opinions can help you make better decisions because it allows you to see the situation from many different viewpoints, it helps you find out what the majority of people think, and it gives you the opportunity to deliberate what option is your best course of action based off many more than your own reasons.

First, it allows you to see your situation from perspectives that aren't your own. When you just ask one person for their opinion on your situation, they might agree with you. But, you know what happens when you just ask one person and they agree with you; you go with your ""gut feeling"" and if you do that then there was no point in asking for an opinion in the first place. However, if you ask multiple people for their opinions then you get many different perspectives, so you can see the situation through the eyes of the person you're fighting with, or running a business with, or having a baby with, etc. That way you can make the better choice because you can now see from the other person's view and understand why they are arguing against you.

I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle; and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made.

Secondly, it helps you find out what the majority of people think. To most people that sounds like a bad thing; most people hear throughout their lives the words ""quality over quantity"". Often times, this is true, especially when it comes to consumer goods. But, if the statement ""quality over quantity"" was always true, why is it not used on everything? Well, when it comes to opinions quality is only determined by your opinion of the opinion. That's why presidential elections use quantity not quality because opinions don't have an official quality. The same is applied to any survey or poll that exists, they all are based on the numbers. So, if the president, the leader of the country, is elected by numbers, why shouldn't you have your own little election when you are faced with a difficult decision and you can't decide what choice is better?

Thirdly, if you ask multiple people for their opinions, you're going to get many reasons as to why they think that way. When people face difficult decisions and they a few choices they often try to come up with their own reasons as to why they should choose any one choice. Unfortunately, people, like myself, aren't the greatest at coming up with their own reasons. So, when you ask multiple people their opinions, you can base your choice on more than just your own, most likely self-centered, reasons. But, if you only ask one person then you're only going to get a few reasons that are based on one opinion and when you can't come up with reasons yourself a few reasons and one opinion isn't helpful.

At last, you've, hopefully, learned and realized why you shouldn't bother thinking about just asking one person for their opinion. You should ask multiple because with just one opinion you can't do anything. If you just ask one person you only get one opinion, and with one opinion you certainly can't find the majority because it's only one opinion. When you ask multiple people their opinions you can find the majority, if you don't want to go with the majority you can use the opinions to look at the situation from a different perspective, and if you don't want to do that just list all the reasons the people had behind their opinions and then decide, in your opinion, which reasons are good, logical reasons and what course of action do they support. Now, I ask you one question, how many opinions do you think you need before you can make a decision?",0
"Dear Senator,

I feel like we should keep the Electoral College because, ""A disput over the outcome of a electoral college vote is possible but, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"". This means that that people would argue over the electoral college vote and who they voted for but but people most likely would not argue over the popular vote. They have done this before in 2012's election prosses with Obama and Romney. The second reason is that everyone will have to put ads up because not just one region of votes will make them president they are going to need to advertise everywhere.

The third reason is that ""the winner-take-all method of awarding Electoral votes induces the canidates"". This means to me that the method helps the canidates so they can win easily. The fourth and final reason is that the big staes get more votes because they have more people in there country so the automatically get more attention from the president. It is also easier for them to get what they want meaning they can reallly like choose any president they want and its a high percenatge that they will get that president.

Those are only some of the reasons that i think we should keep the Electoral College. To me I feel it would be easier to just do this other than count all the votes frome every single voter. Besides what other brillant plan can you come up with that is easier than this?",0
"In the text,""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" it says that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. On paragraph 5 it says, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile coditions on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" I says that NASA does more studying they are going to sent people to study Venus. while, they are studying for Venus they can float around Venus and see it around and how it looks like. In paragraph 7 it says,"" NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" NASA has been trying to study Venus for a long time and they are trying to approach it so they are sending people to study Venus and they have made some inventions. They have been sending it with people that are going to venus and trying it out. NASA is trying to do something with computers called Mechanical Computers. These computer are going to be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. The computer are going to be more better than out computer and phones. In many ways is going to be hard because it does have some risk factor to go to Venus but they are trying to find new inventions are diging up old inventions like the mechanical computers. In many ways I would want to go but then I wouldn't because their is some risk to it.",0
"People often ask multiple people for advice and opinions and think it's a better choice, why though you ask?

I'll tell you my reasons why.

People mostly ask more than one person for advice so that they can ask the next person for good advice if the other person didn't have any, you can take one person's advice and ask another person if it's good or not, and they can use advice that's commonly used.

First off, people ask the next person for advice because if one person doesn't have good advice or just didn't have any, they can move on to the next person who does. If someone doesn't tell them advice, they don't think of just standing there, doing nothing, because of one person that didn't tell them anything. They tell another person, and another person, and ask as many close people as they can for advice.

Secondly, if you asked someone for advice, you can take what that person said and ask if other people say if it's good advice or not. People do this to test if they can trust another person or not. They tell what they said to a trustworthy companion and say if it's good enough opinion that should be taken, or poor advice that shouldn't be taken. If it's good they're trustworthy, and if it isn't they're not trustworthy. Being trustworthy is essential for asking for advice since you can take it knowing they're not lying.

Thirdly, if someone asks a lot of people for advice and they say the same thing, they shoud take that advice since it's commonly used, which is a good thing. It's a good thing because why would a lot of people be taking the same advice if it's bad? So, it has to be great advice. It also depends on how much they trust that person or not, but if they do trust that person, then they should take that advice seriously.

People ask multiple people for advice because they can ask more close friends if one person didn't tell them anything, they can compare that persons advice to other people and see if it's good or not, and they can use advice that's mostly used. Those are my reasons why seeking multiple people for advice and opinions are a better choice.",0
"My position about technology is this brings many effect positive for us huminity life. I take this opinion for the chaning on our life and the support positive in the knowledge.

First reason, for saying the the tecnology have good effects on the human's life is it helps to do many activity fast and easy. For example, many years ago we had to go the store and we watched the stuffed we need. now with the new technology, we do not need to move. we can bay only.

Second reason, tecnology gives support to the knowledge with the creation of new tools and more precision.

For example, before we used the telescopes for treated to understand the universo, now the technology us helps with the creation of new satellite .

Thrid reason, that support the tnechnology have good effects in our economy. For example on market every people want to down the price of production, the new technology helps on this.

In conclution, technology shows to good change on human's life,

"Dear, state senator I do not favor in keeping the Electoral college. What I favor is changing electoral college to election by popular vote. I think that election by popular vote is  very fair and even. Electoral College can  control who their electors vote  it is unfair to the other elector becuse they have no chance of winning the election. Consider that state legislature are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors always defy the will of the people.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. The electoral college is unfair because the winner take all system in most states  they do not have any chance in winning. The electoral college is just outdated, and very irrational. We should abolish the electoral college it is a uncompetitive way for competeing for president. Everyone deserves a fair and even chance and by the electoral college is not.

Popular votes is a non democratic method of selecting a president that gets the the positon with the most electoral votes. It is the electors who elect the president not the people. Everyone has a right to vote for who they would like or trust as president. However it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Whe you vote for president your are actually have a part in who you would like.",0
"Driving Safe

Drivers should not be able to use their phone and any device while operating a vehicle. The driver should be focused on the road and nothing else for that matter. Driving is a privilege for everyone and should be taken away if they take advantage of it. Cars were not invented until the late 19th century (1885 to be exact) People use to use a horse and buggy to get along or they would just walk. Now we have cars instead of the buggys. As stated before, it is a privilege.

Car accidents were not as bad as they are now. Back then, they did not have all of these distractions as we do now. Like the ones we have at our fingertips. Cell phones are really big now; everyone owns one and everyone uses them. With that distraction right by the driver at all times, it is going to be very tempting to pick it up and look at it. They made new laws that were passed a year ago about using a device while driving. It is called the hands free law. This law was passed in 14 states. Also, in 38 states they have banned the use of cellphones while driving.

Did you know ruffley 1.6 million crashes happen annually, queueing up to nearly 390,000 injuries each due by texting and driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. All due to the drivers using their cell phones while driving. It is not hard to drive and not touch or pick up your cell phones; just that habit we all picked up over time.

Driving can be safe again when the cell phones are put up. Driving with them on us is too much of a temptation for us. There needs to be a way to have a safer life. There should be a car designed for your phone. You put your phone in or on something and that way, it's out of your reach. Plus, it starts your car that way if you pick it up the car will come to a safe stop.

Eliminating the risk of the driver wrecking the car in doing so hurting themselves and or others.

That is one way to help with this cell phone driving problem.

In conclusion, there are many awful reasons that driving with a cellular device is bad. It can cause injuries and in some cases, death. It is a privilege to be driving and so for us to take advantage of it, it's not ok. And to put others and yourself in harm's way, it is not what you agree to when you take on the responsibility of driving. People should not be able to drive and use a cellular device at the same time.",0
"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle"" that is mean like some time we are busy. I agree with this prompt becasause it's something posible and if we always doing something.

In my opinion we acomplish more if we are always doing something because some times we have stuff to do for example going to work after school or study after school. But some time people they don't like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. In my position do work it's some i like to do every day because that's how i learn more stuff. IF we have a park time after school that is something good because you are reciving money for your self and maybe you can help your parent with bills.

Some peoples think that if we don't do something in this life we ca have a vetter remposible. That is mean if we don't work or study for a vetter life them we are not going to have nothing for .Exaplem if you are

18 or more you have to look for a jod becase you are respomsible for your self because your parents there are not going to give you anything what you want you have to work and buy your own stuff. This is something posible we can do in us life.

Some may said that to do nothing is better life. they said that becsause they never think about thre future or maybe they don't want to do nothing in the life and that is not going to work. for exaple I have a lot stuff to do for gratuade from hight school i have to pass my esol and have a good great grade if i don't graduate from hight school that choise i have is to work out side. However, if a want the opportituti to do something in the future the best choie is to study effort my self and go to the college to have a better jod.

"The Earth's sister planet, Venus, one of the planets in our solar system we know the least about. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author made good points on how to overcome the difficulties presented by trying to learn more about Venus. Although many of the ways to get around the dangers of Venus didn't completely solve the problems. In my opinion the author didn't support his argument that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

The author contradicted many of his own points by stating facts that show that learning about Venus would be extremely difficult even with current technology. This is shown in paragraph six ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"". Paragraph five spoke of a way scientist would study Venus from a hovering ship but then in paragraph six the author contradicted themself with the quote above.

The author made good points on reasons why Venus is worth studying despite the risks ,but in the end their counter claim outweighed their argument. Although Venus one of the best places to learn about how Earth formed, the risks outweighed the knowlege that would be gained.",0
"Phones and Driving

Phone's and driving are very important parts in today's society. In order to get from one place to another, driving is very important in everyday activities. Driving is an essential part of life as we know it. Phones are very useful and everyone over the age of 13 years old has a cell phone. Phones have many different uses and can prove beneficial to every part of daily life. Phones and driving are very convenient and helpful. The use of phones and driving are a good thing, but when phones and driving are used together in an unsafe way, then it can be very dangerous. As you read, I will offer a better understanding of how phones and driving can help change the world for the better or it can also be dangerous when used incorrectly.

Some helpful ways to use phones while driving is when you're in a new area and need to use the phone for GPS as you drive to get to a specific place. Another useful way to use phones while driving is to report roadside accidents in case of emergencies. Having a phone and driving can also provide you on traffic jams, bad weather, and accidents further down the road. Phones can also be useful when you're driving and get lost and a family member can use your phone's location to pinpoint your exact location.

Some ways that are not helpful to phones and driving is when the phone becomes a bad distraction while driving. Not using a phone properly while driving increases the risk of deadly accidents. When using a cell phone while driving, it takes away from your concentration and focus from the road. When you are distracted, your reaction time is at it's lowest and that can prove to be fatal by causing an accident. A person using a phone while driving isn't paying attention to every aspect of the highway, and by doing so, put's everyone in danger.

There are laws to prevent phones from being used while driving. Many people have lost their lives to distracted drivers while on a cell phone. Georgia has a hands-free law, meaning you can not hold a phone while driving. This law is to help save lives and bring awareness of using phones while driving.

I hope this paper has given you a better understanding of how useful phones can be while driving, and if not used correctly they can be very harmful. It is very important to educate others on the importance of using phones correctly while driving.

"At some point in every ones life,There is a time to be self reliant.

People should make there own decisions, Because, As a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem.

Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan say's ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shot's you take.

Furthermore Making o's own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies else's job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves.

In conclusion being self reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, I could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you.",0
"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",0

"Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College is ruining everything that our fore fathers have worked for! When Americans vote, the majority believe that they are voting for the President of their choice, instead they are voting for a group of people, who will hopefully vote for the candidate they had wanted. The Electoral College is wrong for many reasons, but I'll narrow it down to two for you People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote.

First, The Electoral College is wrong because voters are voting for electors not the President. When voting there are two groups of people voting for the President the People and members of the Electoral College. Members of the Electoral College are actually choose by state legislatures, meaning that their can be a point in time where the state legislature chooses to pick a certain group of people based off of their political party. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the electors from the Democratic party meaning that even if most people voted for Kennedy the president at the time he would still not be elected because electors would not vote for someone who was not apart of their party. It's happen before, so who's to say that it won't happen again.

Second, electors may or may not choose the President based off Popular vote. Even though if we did base the presidential election off of popular vote people might vote based off of region, meaning that most people in the south would vote for someone like rodney, but we have to consider that not everyone in the south would vote for one person. Also it is also true that it electors rarely vote against the Popular vote, but it is possible that the majority of the 538 electors will vote against the people.

In conclusion, The Electoral College should be terminated because People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the Electoral group, meaning that the Popular vote would'nt even matter against the Electoral College. Also the Electoral College may acknowledge the Popular vote, but still vote for a different candidate. If you do choose to help me terminate the Electoral College, I say we try to get help from the guy who actually played the ""Terminator"" I heard that he is part of the government system in California now so he could probably help us.",0

"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, '' A Problem is a change for you to do your best.'' I agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. Unfortunately that not the case. Mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. But adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem. You should be always motivated to do your best.

If you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. No mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. If you don't win that game you at least know that you tried your best. If you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would I have won. This not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. There are many more examples you can try to be your best.

Some times adults have to face problem and they don't know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. They give up form the start they don't try there best when facing that problem. They simply give up. They miss out on that chance. For example, My dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. He did not try his best. he simply gave up. But you should never give up always give it your best no matter what.

Form trying your best you don't lose any thing you only gain something. you can't follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. you will face problems no matter what path you take. For example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. he gave it his best. So why should you not give it your best .

No matter who you are, you should take the words of Duke Ellington and try you best when facing a problem. Does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. or trying to achieve you dreams . Never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it.                                                                                                                              ",0
"Playing an instrument is fun because it can a hobby for the people who are just starting. For example, A piano is used for many types of music. Such as Smooth jazz, Rock, Orchestra, Rap and much more. Pianos requires a great amount of practice and knowing all the keys to create a good music at a play with the audience amused. Professional piano players gets most people's attention by knowing the right keys for the music that the piano players are playing. In addition, There are many tutorials of how to play the piano and learning the right key on social media to begin or improve your piano skills, due to technology. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960's for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. But there are way more instruments than just the piano.

A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use.

There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop. These three types of guitars are very different and attracts people's taste of music because some people are different.",0
"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to read human emotions has recently been invented. It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevent, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school.

To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether or not a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckaman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..."" (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus in class. The author Nick D'Alto also states that the ""software can also identify mixed emotions"" (4). This would allow the teachers to see the students who are stressed and confused and those who are happy and excited. When a student is confused or stressed, the teacher can provide additional practice or tutoring in that subject. The information that a teacher can recieve from the software in very valuable. Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise.

In addition, students can bennefit from this technology in the social environment. According to Dr. Huang ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (4). This means that if a student were getting bullied but they were hiding it, the teachers could find out the information quickly and help the student figure out what is going on. When a student is identified as being sad or depressed, the computer coud show funny pictures to help the student feel better. In fact, ""according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better.

Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very benneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social envirionment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students.",0
"In today's world, many of us see cars as a necesarry tool used to get us where we need to go in the shortest time possible. However, what many do not realize is how much restricting our usage of the personal automobile will actually help society in the long run. Decreasing our usage of the car will not only cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve congestion and see an a boost in the economy of cities and countries around the world.

There is no doubt that cutting down on driving will greatly reduce the emission of grennhouse gases. As detailed in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, the effect of just one day of reduced driving played a signifigant impact on the amount of smog in Paris, France. The smog which covered the city of Paris rivaled that of Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cause of the intense fog is thought to be diesel fuel, which is the most commonly used type of automobile fuel in France. Because of this, Paris has a very high smog concentration compared to other Western European capitals. The temporary ban on driving drastically improved the conditions in Paris, and the ban was lifted after only one day. If this idea of reducing the use of automobiles spreaded to other car-dependent countries such as the U.S., there is no telling how much the impact of society on the emission of greenhouse gasses will reduce.

Additionally, the increasingly popular idea of favoring walking or biking over driving to one's destination has seemed to have a signifigant impact around the world. In the passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the capital city of Bogota, Colombia has participated in the Day Without Cars program for three straight years. This has led to an increase in the creation of bicycle paths and cut down on congestion and traffic jams normally common in the city. In addition, the uprising of parks and recreation centers has also helped to boost the city's economy. However, this program has not been restricted to Bogota, as many people from countries around the world have come to see the event. This has the potential to become an internationally now phenomena, which will greatly improve the health and well-being of the people of the world. New bicycling opprotunities will mean no longer getting in traffic jams and will reduce stress and congestion in the long run.

In conclusion, the limiting of car usage would have a profound impact on our society, not only on pollution and the envorinment, but on our personal well-being. The limiting of our dependency on cars has had a great effect on the emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and smog has the potential to be removed from modern cities all together; the economy would also benefit, as fewer cars means fewer roads needing to be built and an increase of bicycle trails, parks, and shopping centers in walking distance of neighborhoods. Overall, the limiting of car usage would have a fantastic impact on society and our world as a whole.",0
"Phones & Cars: The Dream (Nightmare) Team

Considering that these essays are graded by staff workers who aren't paid enough, I'd think it's fair to say that the reader of this is a driver. Whether you go buy car, bike, bus, etc. it's still driving, and driving should never be combined with texting or phone calling. Using the phone while driving is never safe, neither to yourself nor others.

One key point is that you become distracted. Becoming distracted can cause danger to yourself or others, as you are piloting a giant steel box. Going offroad could hurt yourself. You could also accidentally smash into other cars.

You could also use your phone's bluetooth to stream music to your car's radio. However, since you're only listening to music that you already like, there's a good chance that you might get too into the music and get distracted. This could also cause you to run off the road and potentially hurt yourself and others.

In conclusion, phones can be a dangerous and evil device that can cause harm to you or other drivers while you are on the road. Because of this, you should always put away your phone once you begin driving. Throw it into the back seat or put it in the glove box.",0
"In today's world texting and driving is a normal thing. Over 660,000 deaths and 1.6 million crashes a year, people do it on a regular bases without thinking about it. Texting and driving needs to stop now before more people get hurt. ADD is a big reason too for people have no choice but to get distracted on things which cause crashes.

Distraction is the main reason crashes happen, people get distracted on anything and everything and don't know what to do when they're about to crash. Phones are big distractions in the world today, especially in teens who just start driving, when they get a message the first thing they know to do is check it no matter what. To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered. Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car. It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped.

In conclusion texting and driving is all out bad, and needs to be stopped, there needs to be classes and more lessons taught on the effects of texting and driving. People need to also set an example for the new future because if it's not in forced more teens are liable to do it.",0
"Would you want help from one person are multiple people? I would want more help not less. People ask for advice from multiple people because the people they are asking may of had the problem before and know what to do and they don't know it, and different people give different advice for the same thing.

Choose between a person how had the same experience as you or 10 people that has not which one would you ask for advice. People how have the same problem are most likely going to give you good advice because they know the trouble of the situation and how to get out of it. Not everyone is going though the same problems as you so trust their advice not everyone else. If they know what to do then do it.

Advice is weird someone says some to help you and the someones says the opposite. If no one knows what you are going though then trust the words of the many but only then. it is good to take in all the advice in like a sponge but release the unhelpful one like things you already know are not going to work.

The more advice you have the more changes that are helpful. Many people don't know how to give good advice so ak more so ou can find people who do give good advice.

People who have good advice are out in the world so ask people don't just stand there and wait just ask. It is good to ask lots of people because the more helpful adivice he better. In conslusion it is good to ask multple people for advice you never know who is going to be helpful.",0
"The use of cars has always affected society greatly. There are plans constantly being added to better the environment without the use of cars. Vauban, mentioned in Source 1, can be the start of the car-less world we want to live in. As this expiriment becomes noticed by the world, communities will realize how beneficial this experiment could be. Think about a world with no cars. There would be less pollution and less gasses being emitted into the air. For example, Pairs has just banned driving due to heavy smog. After about five days, car traffic was down 60 percent. Limiting car usage should be implemented heavily because of the greenhouse gas emissions and the happiness of the citizens of Vauban.

To begin with, cars cause many problems and the most important being the emissions of greenhouse gasses. As seen in Source 1, some of the car fillled cities of the United States suffer from up to 50 percect of greenhouse gas emissions. Well-populated cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago could be in great danger. A highly populated city in Colombia, has a ""Car-Free"" day. The goal of this is to allow people to open their eyes and realized how many alternative ways there are to go to work. The implimented a fee of 25 dollars to anyone who violated. I think that by adding a fee, the outcome would be greater and more people would participate. This is a great idea that would open people up to other options. For example, on the third year of the car free day, two other cities joined Bogota. Sometimes we have to open up the eyes of others to really see the change. Also, parks and recreational areas have opened up, uneven sidewalks have been referbished, and most importantly the city has less traffic.

Continuing with pollution, Paris had a near-record of pollution, seen in Source 2. This led to the ban of driving. The ban of driving could be refered to as the limiting of driving. They set up a plan in which cars with even-numbered license plates couldn't drive on Mondays. The same occured for the odd-numbered license plates on Tuesday. They heavily enforced this by implimenting a fine of 22 euros if they used their cars. This idea could work here in America. It would open up carpooling and lessen the amount of cars on the road.

People such as David Goldberg, mentioned in Source 1, are pushing for citites to be less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg mentions the hybrid car. Even though buying a hybrid does not reduce the amount of cars, it does reduce the amount of green house gas emissions.

Seeing the happiness and comfort that the people of Vauban allows us to see what our society could look like. We could live in a society just like theirs, filled with nature. In the United States, the number of licenses has been going down each year. Now, this does not automatically mean that American citizens want to ""be green"". It could be simply because of the fact that cars are expensive, and because we are living in a rough situation. In conclusion, I believe that we should limit car usage for the advantages of less pollution and less greenhouse gasses.",0
"Is using Facial Action Coding System valuable in students classroom? There is alot of talk about using this in classrooms and in other places like so. I don't believe it would be a good decision because one, it would take up so much time, secondly, who says it calculates what is going on in your mind or your true feelings, thirdly why use it in classrooms of all places. There are just many more places it could be used rather than a classroom. Teachers have it hard enough grading the million and one asignments than going through and analyzing their students faces.

First, the Facial Action Coding System will take so much time in one class alone, we can't take away the education from the children in order to see what are emotions are by a face scanner. Let's say you are in a 55 minute math class notes take 30 to 40 minutes a day and the teaher lets students have the beginning 10- 15 minutes of class to ask about last nights homework that all equals 40-55 minutes a day. How would you fit 30 kids into a 10 minute slot to face scan them? That is one more obstical you are going to ask teachers to jump over when they already do so much and get paid so little.

Secondly, Just because a persons face says they are feeling a certain way doesn't mean that is how they truly feel. That is like saying put this mood ring on so I can see your mood. We all know mood rings are based off of body temperature and not your actual mood. There are somethings that people are feeling that they don't want to show, I am not saying that this is a bad thing to do, but maybe not for classrooms.

Thirdly, why in classrooms of all places? Children are very clumbsy there is a better chance it won't get broken at a docotrs office or maybe at a hospital, or anywhere else besides around children. The best place for this could be at a psychiactic unit to see how the psychiatic medication has effected the paitent from day one to now. Children aren't going to be in the same mood now if you check in on them in five minutes.

In conclution, schools should not have these. I think the Facial Action Coding System could be put to use somewhere else besides in a school. Schools are so busy trying to meet regulations, making teachers do what they are to do despite not getting paid very much, and lastly it is a new and improved mood ring we have just made it fancier and given it a new name.",0
"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advantages such as reducing pollution, increasing safety for human beings, and even opening options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of pollutants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with hepburn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vehicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay 40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined 31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public announcement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleaner. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familiar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vehicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases safety, bumping into another human or being nudged by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.",0
"Would you like to know more about Venus? In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains Venus very well. This article has a lot of great infomation.

In the article is said that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. If they was up in the air it would be cooler. ""At thirty plus miles about the surface, temeratures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. This quote explains what people would do just to see the surface of Venus.

The article also talks about how venus could have been an earth like planet. If Venus was like an earth like planet it would be worth the dangers to go see the planet in person. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largley with oceanss and could have supported variousforms of life just like earth"". In this quote the author is explaining what Venus looked like a long time ago. This is another reason he state why going to venus would be worth the dangers.

It also state that it would be good for human curiosity. If we traveled to Venus we could really find out what it is made up of. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has vale, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". In this quote the author explains some thing we would get out of traveling to Venus and that why it would be worth the dangers.

in this article the author explains a lot of good reasons on why we should visit Venus. Even though the dangers of it it would be worth the infomation. It would give Asronomers alot of good information about our sister planet that we may never know.",0
"Have you ever heard somone talk about the ""Face on Mars"" in books, films, tv, or haunted grocery store checkout lines? Well, in 1976, NASA discovered what looked like an Egyptian face on Mar's suface. Many have thought of this to be the work of aleins because the pictures look like there are pyramids and shacks located in the area, but NASA has proven that to be false.

This Egyptian face was, in fact, not made by aliens like many have believed. The ""Face of Mars"" is actually a lava dome that formed like a butte/mesa roughly the same height as Mar's surface. A butte ot mesa is a landform that is common around the American West. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" (p.2) Therefore the ""face"" we see is shadows casting over the butte/mesa shaped lava dome creating the image of a human face. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Garvin. (p.12)

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" was not the work of aliens, but only a lava dome at the surface of the Red Planet. There are many who would still disagree, but NASA has researched and proven the ""Face"" was not made by aliens.",0
"Cell Phones and Vehicles

In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones at all while in a vehicle. I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving. So with these laws it should make the chance of accidents less possible, and police can write tickets so people are less likely to do it again. Now, all new cars are able to have bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have a very old car that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

However, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it's not that easy for the police to catch them.

With bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays. Many people tend to think it's not a big deal to just swipe -it takes only a second. I do think so as well. That one second could cost you a life or somebody's life.

What can stop drivers' using cell phones while driving?

The simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once ""Restriction on cell phones while driving"" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.

I will follow the law once I start driving and hope all the drivers consider about the risk of using the cell phone while driving.",0
"In this article of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it talks about how a facial recognition software can detect your mood. It is brough up in paragraph six that this software should be introduced into classrooms. Classrooms are already getting technologically advanced and are gaining more expenses from this as well. Adding Facial Action Coding Systems to students' computers will just add unwanted price increases, pointless space takeup, and more complexity to computers in our classrooms.

Adding this Facial Action Coding System (FACS) will just add on to the expenses that schools are already putting into place just to add on to the technology that people are trying to push into schools. If a school of lower income tries pushing this system, taxes and school payments will be greatly increased on parents that might not even want this system at all. Although richer schools may be able to afford this software, it will definitely take money away from sections of the school that actually might need attention such as athletics or even music and art classes. Money saved from not buying a software that is just a want and not a need can fork money over to parts of schools that actually need the money. This software is not a necessity and if bought, can take away money from areas that need attention. Not only is the price not needed to be added to, but this software may not even help students in the classroom.

Students in schools with enough money to give students their own laptops usually have used a lot of money on these already expensive devices. Laptops in schools are most usually used to help students who are sick at home to stay connected to their teachers to get assignments. Other uses for the laptops range from eliminating paper and also researching. The FACS software just adds another layer of complexity to the laptops. In paragraph six, the author talks about how the software can see your reaction to ads on screens and adjust new ads to this facial expression. Not only can you be frowning for other reasons than your computer, but if you are doing schoolwork, why does it matter if you are mad or happy? Laptops are to get work done and get through school to help you research and understand topics more. Laptops are not for fun but are tools to help you succeed in school by helping you learn topics applied by the teachers. This software could be extremely helpful at home, but at school it just makes the laptops more complex than they need to be.

If a laptop is being used in school, it is being used as a tool to eliminate paper and help teachers connect to students on a higher level. These laptops are already complex enough to have several tabs at once, documents eliminating paper usage, and also have online textbooks. Some students who are not very educated in technology may see some information gathered and used by laptops to seem very confusing and maybe even frightening. Adding this FACS to laptops at schools will just change how students are seeing their laptops and can be switched around by students making faces at it. If a student is very sad and looks at the computer, it may make things happier and more colorful, but what happens when somebody is very happy? Will the computer turn dark and very bland to make them sad? The software will add another layer to these already complex devices that is not needed. The software may be a want in the eyes of people trying to make school more enjoyable, but this software is merely useless in connection to learning experience. Even with all of these negatives, there are some positives in that some genuinely sad individuals using this software can be cheered up and will actually begin to pay attention to their screens. This software has many negatives but at the same time might actually be used for good in schools that can afford it and still have money left over.

All in all, this software may be helpful to those outside of classrooms, but in reality it may be too expensive for some to implement into these already expensive devices. FACS at its worst will be a price increase, an unneeded software, and a system that will add complexity to these laptops. But, FACS at its best can greatly increase moods of poeple who have acquired this software in hopes of it increasing moods and helping students focus. This software should be relatively unexpensive which will give schools the ability to talk to families about implementing this software into laptops to help students learn. If a school can afford this software and it is approved by families, this definitely can help students focus unless this is too expensive for schools but is added anyways. To conclude, this software is somewhat useless in a way but it is completely up to the school corporation and the families of the school to decided if this should be implemented into our daily lives.",0
"Texting while driving is a profoundly serious topic and it often comes up. Texting and driving are talked about all the time, but people don't take it in consideration to be serious about the situation. Some drivers say ""I can do text while driving"" or ""it'll only take a second"". Thinking / saying that is a foolish thing because all of us feel that we can multitasking. We take these situations lightly until something really happens and then we wish we could take it all back.

Texting and driving can be a serious hazard; for example, a Georgia teen, Cristina PavonBaker, got 15 years for killing her best friend. She was driving 105 mph, racing another student then she started to use snapchat and crashed into a tree. For that reason, I feel that it should be banned in all 50 states because this is a serious cause, and everyone is taking it lightly. People who use cell phones distraction rates are high. In this generation we use our cell phones a lot so when it's hard for us to concentrate and to focus on things that are more important.

When you are texting and driving it's like driving down a soccer field or football field blindfolded. According to my research, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for 2.5 seconds, which is how long it takes to switch lanes. It is dangerous and deadly to not only yourself but also to other drivers and passengers. Texting and driving have beat drinking and driving as the most leading cause of deaths among teens. Us teen are not the only ones, 49 percent of adult drivers admitted that they text and drive.

Teens die every day for making the wrong decisions and not caring about the outcome. We don't care about the law until something happens and we wish that we could go back in time and change everything and not do what we did. The penalties of texting and driving can be jail or prison time or a misdemeanor. The fine could be as low as $20 and as up to $500 depending on the

To sum it up, we would be better if phones weren't allowed in the car at all. You can be killed or can kill someone if you are distracted driving. We are always distracted by our phones so when we are driving, we are tempted to get on it and do stuff. When we do, we have consequences to our actions and sometimes we must pay for what we do. We need to take responsibility and own up for our actions. We need to stop taking things like this lightly. I hope I encouraged you to not do this and put the cell phones down.",0
"I'm in favor of kipping the Electoral college that to the fact that keep out problems and  its fare to evry one. In the text state that ''The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president.'' that shows that the popular vote is the one who wins. Also, In the article says ''The college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast;''And is tre because without the electoral college it will have a lot of candidates that they will not get a majority of vote nether one.

by the way, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible and it hat happend before but it's less likely than a dispute over the populat vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a political preference eather than people who thinks that a single vote may decide an elections",0
"In cartoon sponge bob square pants sponge bob he say's "" imagination"" as to us is inferring for us to use our imagination, like no matter how old you are what disabilities you have is inferring to everyone ,But do you ever think imagination is important than knowledge?

Beginning,with this statement i agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as an other parent would probably say to your child "" your child has a big imagination "". And imagination will always be apart of us we grew up having our little or big imagination's how do you think we would imagine us in the future or like some other examples: how we want to wear out clothes, what type of clothes we wanna wear, what design we want on our cake, or and how we imagine unicorns, ninjas,or any of those type of things ,and superheros. without imagination we wouldnt know about that or the sense of knowing what that is.

Also,

having imagination is also good because were not always gonna use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is,for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind person's life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you wanna know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when there walking down the street or when buying clothes,There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it,or they imagine were this thing is or that thing.

In conclusion, i agree with this statement "" imagination is more important than knowledge "" because for those given reasons like the one about us as kids we would use our imagination and how we would use it for ourselves and the other given example for the blind people how they have that throughout there life spam. therefore those are my reasons i agree with the given statement.",0
"I think curfews do keep teenagers out of trouble and it helps them sleep on time because after those hours a lot of law breaker are on the streets and something bad could be happening outside or on the streets like gang fights , shootings , robbers , durg dealers, drunk drivers and many more. The first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after 10 p. m and it would be better to stay inside in those hours than to go outside and for example a teenager is walking home from a friends house late in the midnight and gets in a fight with gang member and gets shot. while it would have been better with the curfew in place.

Curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day. And another example a teenager has a game he does not sleep early and he wakes up tried and is not able to play the game as well as he could.

Curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropritely and how they spend the day for example a teenagers has a project or a home work the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep.

In conclusion adopting the curfew idea would be good because it will keep the teenagers out of trouble and help them mange their time appropritely.",0
"This could be it, the new Facial Action Coding System ! This system is a very unique way to tell and spoil how you are really feeling and what your emotions are. This new system starts with a 3-D computer model and all of the human muscles. It will basically scan your face and tell you your emotions. I think this is a fantastic way to get people to change there mood or to tell how people really feel because people hide there emotions and this system could be a new big thing.

Some people may not agree on many things, but maybe people could try this. Some adults worry about how student or there children are feeling and if they did the Facial Action Coding System it would be a way to express there emotions and tell how they really feel. It's as simple as a fake or real smile, the rising of an eyebrow, or even the squinting of your eyes. All of those qualities can tell you what your emotions are with using the Facial Action Coding System. Like the passage states, "" The Mona Lisa demomstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face "", and so could the FACS. Seeing student down isn't pleasent and shouldn't be. Using the FACS is a way to tell, but don't put on a fake smile !

The Facial Action Coding System could go world wide and change lives. It could go to every school and make a difference ! This system could be valuable but some people may see it different. Not everyone would want to do this because some don't want to express there emotions. If schools invested in this system, it could change those that don't want expressed to being expressed and happier. It could also just tell you where your're at and what emotions you could work on or otherwise. Some may like, and some may not. Reasearchers show the putting on a ""

Real Smile "" can make you happier and change your mood. The science of emotions could be a thing of the future, but even more so with the Facial Action Coding System.",0
"By the author of this topic is really persauding by true facts where it makes u think. Can we really live on venus the normal way or a new way? During all this time all the best and expert sciencetist are working together to test a method nd see if we can live on that planet without dying or not producing food or water or even shelter. While testing we figured out that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. So that is why I think during the proccess on living venus or in the future testing methods if we could live pn venus or see if we can grow crops or bring like equiment to test samples on we can evole on this planet near us. Even the thought of going to a new planet is a big turn of events because we dont know how its atmosphere works or gravity or air/oxygen or weather climate change or anything but we are learning about it really fast where we have to make a high expert group of people to risk their lives to see if we can produce our species or our tech,food,citys, or even animal life in conculsion to make sure that we sure we dont make the smallest mistake to screw up the plans for us to live or visit venus in future but in mean time we have people training to become the best of the best for this secret peoject if it happens. So that is all i gotta say and i hope it does happen to make history on the board for people to live on a new generation. So our main goal is all about Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Even NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers",0
"Dear Senator

I am writing this letter to you to tell why i think we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote. See the thing is Senator the Electoral College seems like a biais to me, its unfair to the people. Many Americans dont vote because they fair that that votes won't go to the right person because in truth and in facts when the American people vote they're not voting for who's to become president they vote for the electors and not knowing that the electors dont always vote for the same person the voted for so all Americans are doing is meaningless voting because they dont really have a choice they may think they voting for Obama and the electors voted for Romney. And thats why most Americans dont vote.

I feel it wouuld be best if all voting is done by popular vote , because either way all of the American people dont get a say in the voting rules but at least they know that there not being cheated.

Because when they vote by electoral college most states dont even get the chance to vote because its small or under populated , which is unfair not because you know a state is small and it might not make a difference doesn't means they dont have the right to vote its totally unfair.",0
"Air polution, no money, and death, Oh my! Everywhere you go there are going to be cars. One of the most helpful and loving inventions of our time, it gets us from place to place in a short amount of time. But is getting to where you need to go faster really worth it? Money, safety, and protection to our environment all play huge roles when it comes to cars. The population of our world grows every year, which means more cars... Which means more air polution, more deaths, more of spending your money.

Owning a car also comes a lot of things. Money for gas, money for parts that stop working, etc. With gas prices up and down all the time, we find ourselves spending way too much money just to fill up our vehicle. You would be amazed at how much more money you would have if you weren't spending on gas and other things your car needs. It also requires no excercise at all, which is really a disadvantage to our health. Imagine what a simple difference can make. If we all walked or biked to where we needed to go, we're doing something great for our bodies and our environment. Not only is it jeopordizing our health, but our own environment's, too! Every single car and every single drive is polluting our air. Do we really want to end up like Beijing, China? As of now, they are known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. What about safety? Car crashes are one of the most common deaths. Such as two major factors, texting while drving and driving under the influence. No matter what state you're in, when you get behind that wheel you hold a big responsibility. So is putting your life on the line really worth it?

By limiting car usage, we can make a difference throughout the world. We can lower stress, death rate, air pollution, spendings, and so much more. If ONE day of the Day Without Cars in Columbia made a difference, imagine what a whole year, or years, could make. There are so many better options to get to where you need to go other than cars, such as bikes. So what if you don't get there as fast as you would in a car? The point is, you're still getting there. You're also not putting you and other's lives on the line. Better for the environment, better for others, better for you!",0
"In the article "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"", there has been an argument about whether or whether not it is a natural landform. Some people suggest that it was formed by alien life on Mars and some people believe that it is a natrual landform. I believe it is a natural landform because of what the scientists have found.

The text states, ...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Not only was the Face formed but it was also and illusion. The text also states, ""...snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos...revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The scientists had taken a better picture after they viewed it again proving it was a natural landform. Lastly, although not everyone was satisfied, the scientists had stated, "" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, it's hard work."" This shows that just because the supposed ""alien markings"" were hidden by clouds or haze, doesn't mean they are alien markings. The text states, "" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, It's hard work..."" So to prove that the "" alien markings"" was just a natural landform, scientists took a second look and captured the best photo they have and proved that is was just a butte or a mesa which were "" common landforms around the American West."" This evidence shows that is is a natural landform that is an equivalent to America's common landforms.

I believe that it is a natural landform because of what scientists have found. Scientists have taken pictures and second looks of those pictures to prove that the Face isn't ""alien markings"", but a natural landform. All this evidence proves that the Face is a natural landform and while my evidence shows something else, there could be evidence that shows it is alien markings. So what is your view on the Face?",0

""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""plaza par.24. I think it is a good idea to banned cars for a few days. This is my opinion because if we take cars away then people will see how much more clear the air is, how much easier it is to breath, what good excersie it is for you, it will open some peoples minds about how the environment works and how bad cars are for our economy. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders""rivera par.26.

"When most people think of space programs in the near future, they often think of missions to Mars. However, this is not the only option. Many scientists at NASA are working to create a Venus space program. This research is supported by the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". The article does this well, by providing factual evidence, deterring counterarguments, and rethinking the problem to be easier to address.

One of the most important parts of any claim is the evidence. The article fufills this with arguements that Venus is easy to reach. The author states that ""Venus is sometimes right around the corner--in sace terms"" (Venus 2). They also used evidence to address the problem that Venus is inhospitable to humans. on the surface, Venus is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, but the author points out that a vehicle at a much higher altitude would have a temperature of around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

That isn't the only way problems such as this could be averted. The author also includes some NASA research on elecronics and mechanical computers that use no electricity and don't easily break.

All of these now solved problems have deterred scientists from finding ways to research Venus. The author addresses this as well. They say that ""maybe we should think of them [the problems] as challenges""(Venus 6). This way of thinking makes getting to Venus seem much more achievable.

With all of these good traits of an article, the author argued that researching way of going to Venus is a good idea after all. In the end, only time will tell whether humans get to Venus or Mars first.",0
"As crazy as living without a car sounds, more and more people are doing it. One popular reason for it is for a healthier and happier lifestyle. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's short story titled In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Heidrun Walter reports ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Her and many others like her in the town of Vauban, Germany have experienced the difference and felt stress go away. The city has banned driveways and home garages, encouraging the rule of living ""carfree."" The people rely on public transit, bicycles and their own two legs. While many people are stressing to get a car, the people of the town feel stressed if they have a car. Over half the population sold their cars to move there, and don't regret a thing. In the article titled Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , Andrew Selsky quotes Carlos Arturo Plaza as saying ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"" as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.

Also Carlos Arturo Plaza goes on to say ""it's a good opportunity to lower air pollution."" People are realizing how many pollutants that cars emitt into the atmosphere. One example place is Paris, known for their terrible smog, has finally done something to clean it up. Robert Duffer wrote in ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The law stated even numbered license plates couldn't drive one day, and the other, odd license plates couldn't. A little thing like this had a big effect. Duffer then reported ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" Elizabeth Rosenthal in the article The End of Car Culture showed the idea "" if these patterns persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Americans are partically to blame for pollution. Our need for the newest, biggest, best things, has come at a cost, and more than money. Greenhouse gases are stacking up, and we have to take a stand some time. Rosenthal goes on to describe political leaders are working to fix this too, ""President Obama's abitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions were unveiled last week."" In places already practicing the no car rule, environments have improved more than pollution wise. Andrew Selsky reported of ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" These two additions of Bogota, Colombia have inspired many people to turn in their keys, and take a hike instead. Not only have these changes made people more happy, but it makes their city more beautiful and they are starting to get outdoors and see it. The author reports that ""municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event carfree day and were enthuriastic,"" amung the people visiting was the Mayor of Paraguay's capital city. When more people see the effects, they want to do the same thing. Columbia's one day event has brought about much talk in neighboring towns and even ""two other Colombian cities, Calli and Valledupar, joined the event."" On the other side of the argument, many car industries are trying to compete with these new ideas and technology. Rosenthal quotes in ""But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" As humans advance into the ideas of walking, biking, or taking public transportation, car companies strive to become known for things other than cars. They want to be able to sell you things still, even if you don't want or need a car. Later she writes how Bill Ford proposed the fresh idea at the Mobile World Congress that car dealers should ""partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This long quote simply means having all forms of transportion and the new technology in communications to be one, for the better of the people.

With or without cars, we all are always on the move. Some cities have adapted new ideas to get from place to place, or simply old ideas, being put back into action. Although Henry Ford would probably be dissapointed at his invention being faded out, Mother Nature would be pleased of us taking care of Earth. We never know what the future holds, but we do know, we'll always only have one home, so we better take care of it.",0
"In ""The Challege of Exploring Venus,"" the author says that further study of the planet Venus would be a worthy pursuit for humanity. Closer examination of Venus presents many dangers, but despite this, the author still believes that learning more about Venus would be worth while. The author supports his belief by explaining some of the curiosities that draw humans to Venus--such as the posibilty of having had life previously--, by comparing Venus to our home planet of Earth, and by exploring some of the ideas for how Venus could be explored.

In order to convince the reader that further exploration of Venus is worth the risk, the author peaks the reader's interest with ideas about the planet. The author knows that the idea of life existing outside of Earth is common thought for most people, so he tosses out the possiblity of Venus having previously supported life. He states that Venus was likely covered in oceans previously and, ""could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Life on other planets has fascinated people for generations, and the author decides to use this to try and convince the reader that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its presents.

The author continues to explain the reasons to further explore Venus, which he begins to aid with facts. The author describes how close Venus is to Earth, relatively speaking. He says that at times Venus is the closest planet to Earth. The author also decsribes the similarities that Venus has to Earth, including size, density, and surface. This author uses facts that support his claim to try and convince the reader of his idea, which works well in this case.

Like any good argument, the author highlights some counter arguments, and then gives possible solutions. For example, the author explains the harsh conditions of Venus such as high temperature and high atmospheric pressure. The author even tells the reader that, ""no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."" All of these seem like deal breakers, but the author does a good job of countering these points with solutions. The author describes ideas from NASA, such as a ""blimp-like vehicle"" that would float about thirty miles above the surface of Venus and avoid many of the harshest conition. He also disusses the use of electronics made of silicon carbide that would be better equipped to handle the intense conditions of Venus. The author looks at flaws in his idea, and finds solutions to them.

The author of this article believes that while studying Venus poses some challenges and dangers, but that it would be worth it. He explains why people are interested in Venus, and why it is a task that can be accomplished. He looks at counter points to his idea, and finds ways around them. This author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is worth the dangers it presents.",0
"To whome it may concern,

From my knowledge based on the sources i've been given on the Electorial College, I strongly beleive it should be abolished. To me it seems senseless to be voting for a slate of electors rather than a president. Also, anyone not in office can be an elector so that means they may not be the best person to be representing your vote. The electors may only vote for who they want rather than go with the vote of the people which is why I beleive the president should be elected by popular vote. This would also mean there would never be a tie. In the event of a tie the House of Representatives would take the vote. So the representative of Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have the same power of as the representative of California, representing 35 million voters. it should be quite clear why popular vote would make more sense. We have outgrown the electorial college as a nation.

Thank you for your time,

"First off, we can not say it was an alien who creater these human-like faces. We can't prove it was an alien at this time, because we haven't even figured out if aliens even exist! It most likey was a nautural landform, because over time, rock formation could've combined all together to create this face-like figure on mars.

Next, this is obviously a landform, and not created by aliens, because, during those cases, there was no alien monument after all! Also, on April 5, 1998, thousands of web users were anxiously waiting for the very first image on a JPL web site, which seemed to reveal that it was actually a natural landform.

Next, not everyone was happy with the results of it being a natural landform and not created by a alien. The ""face on Mars"" became such a big deal, it was in films, magazines, books, radio shows, and most likely your checkout line at your local grocery store!

Fourth, many people were wondering why NASA didn't just hide the discoveries of the life on Mars. Conspiracy theorists say ""life on Mars"", evidence that NASA workers would have rather hide to prevent too many questions on the face.

To conclude, maybe it was all just a huge rock formation, since aliens have no evidence that they actuslly exist, or have been seen by a human. So what do you think? Do you think aliens may have created this landform, or was it just a natural lanform?",0
"In my opinion it's not a good idea because in every country in world it's role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they don't like school the only reason they don't like the school is that they wake up early and they can't sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. it's good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance.

In the other country's the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years.

Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that it's not good to graduate early because you didn't learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they can't answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he did'nt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity.

Working in school time is not good for student, because he can't learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he did'nt study he can't graduate. it's rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 it's not to work his family have to support him to study. It's family responsibilty to tell his child to study. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosen't have to study too much because collage is easy that school.

I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didn't study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule.

"Most people seek advice from multiple individuals when faced with a problem, and they have good reason too. Speaking to multiple people about advice can help the person searching for it open new doors. Seeking advice from others is highly beneficial because they can help the person see another point of view or help him or her see flaws or strengths in an already existing idea.

When someone asks multiple people for advice, that person is given the opportunity of seeing different points of view. Perhaps this person could see no other option but his or her own. But since all of our brains work differently, going to other people for new ideas could help open up other pathways to a solution.

Additionally, seeking advice from multiple persons may help the seeker see a flaw in an existing idea. Hearing what other people think about an individual's idea could help see what could be improved upon. Similarly, this could also help that individual see strengths that prove that his or her's initial idea is the right choice.

In conclusion, gathering advice from many people helps someone see new possibilities to an idea or see strengths and weaknesses of a preexisting one. Getting a fresh look at a problem can help someone see new ways it can be solved. Advice from others can also help critique an idea. The many people that seek advice from multiple sources are utilizing every tool they have access to.",0
"The electoral college is not a good thing and it certainly messes things up it takes votes away from people, It changes the votes to make a person lose presidency even by changing the senators, and it's a winner take all system these dont turn out good no matter what. It's even overthrowing the people with the popular vote yes it sadly is possible.

Why would you still have the electoral college if it doesnt help anyone at all?

There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote. The odds of one side winning is easily changed with electoral votes. This interrupts the odds of how much the people likes them then it turns into how much the government of states likes them. However it could help some people win if they are not the popular vote.

It can also make anyone with the popular vote lose when they should have won like after Al Gore during the gallop poll thanks to the perks of the electoral college won the popular vote but he lost presidency over it. Even though 60% of people prefer the direct election now some prefer the electoral college.

But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it. A good argument was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says ""in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would oppose John F. kennedy"" that is just evil. Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made.

Even at the most basic level the electoral college is still unfair to voters because of the winner take all system put in place for each state. They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says ""Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races"" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate exept for Maine and Nebraska it is being used for what they are using it for.

In all the electoral system is not good but its not all bad it takes the votes away from the people,Its a winner take all system, and its taking people down who deserve to win even changing the senators to make them win. Its evil and makes no sense to what they are doing trying to give other parties a chance i get it but its gone a little to far.",0

"Do our character have to be formed by that way the we performed or by influences. Your character will be what yourself choose to make it. We should formed our character by influences beyond our control.

In addition, by the influences that we receive day by day we chooses how to be creating our character. For example, I introduced my character in the situations the I pass, that help me how to be a better person. Also, sometimes we take our family advice, they tried to persuade our character by doing incorrect things. In others words we can said that they just want to influences our self because they ready pass for al this things that is good because we can see how much love they have to us. Is wonderful when your mom tell you the she can't believe that way the you get influences because sometimes we don't want to get they advice but all that they said is correct event if we don't want to believe then. For example my parent always want the betters things to me but i know if i don't try to fix my character I going to have less opportunities to have a better job or a better future. Also, Things are necessary somethings is hart to change our character because we think the we are okay but other think all the appositive, so we never have to think the we are fine because the never is going to happened always we have to be better in some thing we need to be honest with our lives and accept what we are doing wrong is more better to accept our errors and there is went we are going to see how our character change in a better way and then we are going to feel happy about our character and our lives.

Moreover, The influences control our character by the way the we act and think. For example, I was a person the if something I don't like I really have to talk to you the was horrible. Also my mom help me to change my character in my way to act because went sometimes people tell me things the I really don't like I do bad faces to then, I was doing bad with that. In other way, we don't think in the consequences of having a bad character, sometimes we don't think if others are going to see the actions in our lives and they maybe are going to influences you but no we the same attitude, because some people have bad attitude to but all the influences help you in life because if you don't like the people act with a bad attitude you don't have to be like that to. Also, you have to be prepared to make the decisions of what changes you are going to make. Having a good character gives you large of opportunities people always is looking for person with a good character,because costumer look the. In addition, all thinks the people said about you help you with your character, don't feel sad because you change your way to think. Obviously the take your time because you are not going to change in one morning but with a professional character more doors are going to open and more opportunities came so take other people influences.

Some people argument the we should choose our own character traits, because some people just are going to tell you bad opinions in the way the you have to act. Moreover, some people believe the is no necessary to get a great character. In other hand we have to feel free in what we want to do we know what we need to change we don't have to do what others want because sometimes they just look for they benefits what is better for then and that dont have to be like that. In addition, some people don't care if you are okay, or how you feel. In addition others argument the is necessary listen to others influences because sometimes we don't find a way to resolve our character problems bur other know what to do and they try to find a way to make you live easy. For example, I know some people the dont know how to control they character when they are mad soy they contact person the know how to act in the situations. Also, some people take careers for find solution to person the have serious problems with they character I really dont know if is normal the people get mad went they want to eat, I have a friend with the problem in my point of view the is not normal because i never pass from the situation so I can't help her but people the have long time studying on the yes they can tell her what way to eat or i don't know but they have a solution for the problem in her character. In Addition all this problems can help you to have a good character a better attitude because is necessary for talk with other because we need to have a way a formed how to talk without breaking they feelings because as humans the we are we feel sad went other trade us with a mad face and sometimes we performed don't talk to then. So always remember the a good attitude change to many things.

In Conclusion, sometimes is necessary be influencing by other because they give you different ways how to be working in your character. In addition they received influences by other help you with the control in your character by changing a your way to act and covert you in a better person. Also help your character in a better way to think, in be focus on your ideas. In conclusion all this things are necessary in whatever way the you want to used then because in the proved of the live all things are necessary event if are smalls things they are necessary don't thing the people just influences your self in change your character because they just want to fight with not the is not like that is people is trying to give you a better influences about how you have to act because they always want better things to you. Always if you do bad on your character they are going to tell you and I thing the is more better if they tell you what you are doing wrong the others persons the you don't know came just for the just because you don't want to obey always think in you future. The is necessary a excellent character for a better work or food different's things the you want to realized.",0
"Do you know why the earth has air pollution ? they are many reason from cars. Limiting car usage could have many advances because it can slow down air pollution,save money, and safety. Sit back and relax while I explain.

To begin one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that it can slow down air pollution.

First reason that limiting car usage is that it can slow down air pollution is that because in the passage it says that ""after days of nearrecord pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" what that quote was basically saying was that the air pollution in paris was so terrible that they had to ban driving in order for the air to get stabilized. Next limiting car usage can slow down car pollution because it will keep major fuel companies from burning coal into the air. Lastly limiting car usage can slow down air pollution by using bikes,walking,taking the bus,riding skate boards,taking the subway,and ect.

Next one of the advantages of limiting car usage is it saves money.

the first reason limiting car usage saves money is because in one of the passages it says that ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violaters are to face 25 fines"". and I dont think any one want to be a part of that. Next one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that it saves money because when a person has a car they spend lots on money to put gas in their car every week and every year gas prices are rising. finally one of the advantages on limiting car usage is it saves money is because people that drive have to be aware of tickets that are very expensive also mantanace for your car like tires, lights,oil and ect if you limit your car usage over time you will see yourself spending less.

Finally one advantage on limiting car usage is safety. The first reason lmiting car usage can raise safety is because in the passage it says ""pedestrian,bicycle,private cars,commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time,conserve resouses,lower emissions and improve safety"". The next reason limiting car usage can bring safety is by stoping traffic jams and droping the percentage of the amount of people dying fron car accidents. The final reason limiting car usage can bring safety keeping motorcyclists,bikers,and pedestrians from getting hit by cars also keeping drunk drivers of the streets.

To sum up they are many advantages of limiting car usage ,my reasons are it can slow down air pollution,save money, and safety I told you my reasons now tell me yours.",0
"Many people across the country would believe that having an Electoral College is good idea. Well, I belive thst it is not a good idea to continue having an Electoral College to chose our president because the people deserve to have their votes count. In the prcocess of having an Electoral College the poular votes do not count, only the slate of electors can vote for the canidate. That's not even the worst part to begin with.

In source 2, it says that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half the amount of voters in the country! It even states ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" meaning that sometimes the electors would not always have the same idea in mind as the people have. To me that is a real bummer especially for the people in the state with those kinds of electors.

Furthermore, the Electoral college may have a few benefits as it states in source 3. Fore example, it says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" meaning that barely anyone would vote in the state. But that is usually a rare ocasion and is easily avoided in every state. As individuals we would usually not avoid coming to vote in an election for certain positions especially when it comes to a president.

Sometimes people would even let the Electoral College vote for them without the people knowing who they voted for. The Electoral College is supposed to represent their state towards a canidate but what if the state rarely has any electors to be represeted or doesn't have any at all? That is why it is up to the people to make their own decision in who they want to vote for and hopefully their vote counts. The Electorial College may be recomended to represent their state but they can never represent every individual's vote because not all people have the same canidate in mind and the Electorial College can only vote for one canidate.

Overall, I think the Electoral College should be abolished in every way. It is the people's vote that should count not the electors. Some people may disagree but I still believe the Electorial College is not good for us. It is not truely fair to have the majority of popular votes on one canidate and still that canidate does not win due the Electoral College. So I can most certainly agree with what previous people and groups have said before such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerance, and the AFL-CIO.... To get rid of the Electoral College.",0
"Texting and Driving

Texting while driving is a continuous topic and a very debated one. Some people believe that texting is okay while driving but I'm here to argue that it's not. People all over the world have died or gotten injured due to sending a short text or even looking at their phone. Not only does texting and driving put your life in danger it also puts the people around you at risk. When operating a vehicle, we always need to keep our eyes on the road.

Texting while driving should be illegal

""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" source from EdgarSnyder. com says. However, when you're operating a vehicle you should not distract yourself for harm to come your way or another's. Many families; mothers, fathers, and children die due to car crashes and the leading cause is texting. Many children grow up in a home without their mother or father because of a simple text.

In the state of Georgia, last year a girl was going down the highway playing on her phone and got into a car accident, ended up killing her friend and was sentenced to 15 years 3 years in prison and 12 years of probation for murder. There are many consequences from texting and driving, I can either be as small as a ticket or as far as death and prison time. The death over texting while has increased over the years. Mothers and fathers should not be burying their children.

However, some people will try to debate that they need their phone, or it was important, and it very may well have been, but if it wasn't an emergency then there is no reason to be on their phone. Everybody has the choice to pull over if they want to be on the phone. Quick example, most people can't even walk and chew gum and think that they can drive and text. Although it's not just texting while driving, I feel as though you shouldn't be on your phone while on the road period. Many people die from texting and walking into the street and not looking.

Operating a car can be dangerous enough therefore you shouldn't put your life in more danger by using a phone. A text will be there when you park your car. Imagine it being your son or daughter that gets killed because someone was texting while driving, so why put others or yourself in danger like that? Why put your freedom on the line like that? Would you be willing to risk it all for one text?",0
"Cars have been used as the main means of transportation for a long time now, but just because we have counted on it for such a long time doesnt mean there are not better ways. There are a ton of advantages for limiting car usage. Lower emissions, conserving resources, and it make us more healthier are just some of the reaons ways that limiting car usage will improve our daily lifestyles.

To begin with, one of the advantages of limting car usage is improved emissions. Today cities all around are poisoning people with toxic air, cars being the main contributers. But it doesnt have to be this way, some cities are doing things to change. In Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the global city. Also in Bogota, Columbia has made a difference by incorporating a yearly Day Without Cars. One day out of the entire year is not going to clear up the global air quality but it does opens peoples eyes up to alternative ways of getting around without the use of cars. A businessman even reported that it is a good opportunity to take aways stresses. For the first time, two other Columbian cities have joined in on the event. All of this just proves that cars arent the only way.

In addition to lowering emissions, another advantage of limiting car usage is it would conserve resources. Think about how many cars are in the world. THERE ARE ALOT! So every car in the world uses resources to keep it running, even electric and hybrid cars eventhough they are a great alternative. But most use fossil fuels. The world doesnt have a unlimited supply of fossil fuels. It took millions of years t make the gas we put in our cars. So eventually we will run out and when we do it will take a very long time to get it back. Also think about the generation of people after us. What will we leave behind for them?

Lastly, limiting the use of cars will improve our heath. Before the invention of cars most of the population who walk. Eventhough it would take longer to get from place to place it will benefit use also. American, sadly, is probably the laziest county in the world. You rarely see people walking or riding a bike to and form work on a daily basis eventhough in real busy cities you probably would get to and from work faster cause you wouldnt have to wait in the morning or evening rush hour. Its also ceeper than using your cars, you are going to spend a rediculous amount of money on gas in a year, so think it will help the environment and your wallet.

A study last year has showed that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe we are the generation to make the change to other ways of getting around, advantages being lower emissions, conservation of resources, and a healthier you. So just remember the next time you have ot go to the store, just take a bike.",0
"In this article about the new technology being used on the painting of Mona Lisa the audience learns about what this new technology is really about. The first sentence of the first paragraph the author states ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Since the author begins this article with the percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions, we know that this is going to be about reading someones emotions, not only Mona Lisa's.

Further into the article we read about this technology being in computers and recognizing facial expressions. To have a computer be able to even calculate ones expression, the computer must construct a 3-D model of the face electronically. Imagine sitting infront of your own computer while having it read what you're feeling! This advanced technology is more than what we think. The technology actually improves lessons in school, based on an individuals expression.

To have this technology in a classroom, it would be highly beneficial to students and even teachers. The benefits a student would be receiving are improved grades, lesson plans that are interesting, being more focused, and having more benefits with learning than what a teacher could give. Improving grades can be hard and that could very well be because a student is just not able to pay attention to the lesson due to how boring or confusing it may be. In the article the author says ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Using this to help determine a better lesson plan for the student is great because it will make them more focused along with being interested in their learning plan. This can lead to the student knowing what they are doing on their homeowork which also leads to better grades.

Some may disagree with the opionion of having this technology used in classrooms. Others may say that no matter the lesson, the student could just simply be tired or un-interested in learning. If a student is either of those, they could very well not have a benefit to this technology. However, it is more likely that a bigger percentage of students woud have a positive outcome while having this advanced technology in the classrooms.

Those who believe that this computer technology is not valued in classrooms could think that the software might not work effectivley. When saying this, I am saying that those people may think that the technology won't really read a students expression correctly. The creators of the software could possibly not have all of this technology figured out 100 percent. Although that could be the case, we should focus on whether the students believe they are being benefitted while using it.

There will always be one opinion or the other. However, reading this article makes me believe that having this technology in classrooms would be highly beneficial to students. Getting good grades is a big part of actually being able to enjoy or understand your lesson. While having better lessons, you will most likely have better grades. Teachers possibly can not benefit the students in the way this new technology could with lesson plans and maybe more. That is why most people should believe that having the expression reading computer technology in classrooms is good for the students in more ways than one.",0
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" David Goldberg. Automobiles have been a major impact on today's technology. The creation of the car was a huge turning point in history. Even though this machine has been such an amazing creation, it still causes a lot of damage in society. Cars affect both the environment and humans. The limit of car usage would be great because then the amount of pollution would decrease, less traffic would occur, and it makes way for alternative transportation opportunities.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. The reduction of cars can lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities are choking due to the increase number of emissions. Paris had hit nearrecord pollution which lead to an enforced ban of partial driving to clear the air of the global city. according to Robert Duffer, Paris typically has more smog than other European capital. In Bogota, Colombia there is a day called Day Without Cars, there they only let buses and taxis drive around and their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If anybody goes against this, they would have to pay 25. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. This day became really big in Colombia and improved their cities overall look.

Furthermore, the limitation of car usage would decrease the amount of traffic. Traffic is an ongoing issue in everyday life. People arrive late to work or school or wherever they need to go due to traffic or an accident. During the Day Without Cars in Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses, leaving the city devoid of traffic jams. Traffic jams are usually stressful so if that gets reduced with the limitation of car usage, then stress levels get reduced as well, causing mentally healthier people. Traffic jams also occur due to accidents. Car accidents are one of the many reasons why people end up in hospitals, get sued, get hurt, or loose money. With the limitation of car usage, all these issues will be resolved.

Moreover, new alternative transportation vehicles can come into play with the reduction on car usage. There is a plan where they want suburbs to play a much larger role in a new sixyear federal transportation bill to be approved. Also, during the Day Without Cars, the goal is to promote alternative transportation. Lately, new transportation vehicles have been discovered and created. Some include, a flying car, an elevated train that gets you from point A to point B in seconds, and new hybrid cars. Technology keeps progressing every single day. Today people may be driving their normal SUVs but by tomorrow, they could be drivng the new highspeed flying Ferrari. People are always keeping in mind while creating these machines about how it will affect the community and the consumers. Since it is obvious that the environment isn't as healthy as it was before, they must make sure that these machines limit pollution and emissions that affect the world negatively.

Overall, the limit of car usage would be a good thing. As time goes on people may not even need cars anymore to move from place to place. If everyone works together to solve these issues then the world would become a much better place. The final goal is to get rid of all the bad emissions and issues and just stick to what is best for the environment. When the environment is healthy, the humans are healthy.",0
"Venus is one of the planets that have the same density and size and used to have mountains,valleys,craters and it also used to have oceans which means it used to have life but the pressure will kill us because the pressure is 90 times stronger than ours.

It is hard to go to venus because sometimes we are farther and sometimes we are closer to venus. All of our space missions to venus have been unmaned because no spacescrafts hasnt survivded the landing longer than a few hours. on the planets surface the atmodspheric pressure is 90 time than on our own planet. venus used to be covered with oceans and had valleys. mountains and craters. NASA want to send people to study venus. a vehicle would be needed to hover across venus surface. systems made by mechanical devices will by crushed by the pressure.

So the exploration of venus will be difficult but we will soon need a planet because once we run out of material we wont be able to go anywhere.",0
"Since the time of its discovery, the ""Face on Mars"" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counter-arguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.

Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the ""fiction"" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.

The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counter-argument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counter-argument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the ""Face on Mars"" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution.",0
"There are many fellow citizens in the world that have been using cars are having car accidents and many more terrible things that have happen during inside of a car or outside of a car. According to the passage, Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters. Is better to take a walk, ride a bike, and make the streets a better place. Especially, that up to 50 percent in the United States, there are carintensive areas. Car free day, was a big hit in Bogota, and should make it in the United States one day to leave the streets without traffic jams.

First, fellow citizens should stop the car usage, to make the streets a better place, walk, ride a bike, or do something that would make the streets much safer. The cars usage, many people have died for these terrible accidents. Limiting car usage, is a great idea, because it supports the streets to not become very dangerous. There are many accidents that have caused of a hitandrun. So is very important that at least the car usage should stop the humanity.

Next, Limiting car usage, is a great idea, because, according to the passage, up to 50 percent in the United States, there are carintensive areas. Carintensive areas, such as the traffic jam. Traffic jam, can be very dangerous at some point, and it keeps people very tired and frustrated. According to the article, In Bogota, Colombia, there's a program set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to keep the area as a carfree day, leaving the streets devoiding of traffic jams. So try to ride a bike, walk, skate, or do something, that can be a carfree day, a much safer environment.

Then, Limiting car usage, is a great idea, also, because without cars, and only buses and taxis, a which the main goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, Violators have faced 25 of fines, according to the article, also. Its a really good opportunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution from cars, especially the stress from traffic jams. As what i was saying in the beggining, that many people prefer to use bike, walk, or skate to keep themselves a much safer habit. If your driving, always put on the seatbelt to prevent from car accidents. Limiting car usage is a great way to prevent from all the car accidents out there in the world.

Last, Limiting car usage is a great way to the environment, makes the countries a better place. Having a carfree day, especially, is a much safer way to its environment. Ride a bike, walk, skate, or take a bus, if necessary, to prevent from all the car accidents out there in the world, it takes away the stress and decrease its air pollution from having a carfree day, and to promote from alternative transportation and reducing smog. Limiting car usage, is great way to our planet, but there is times that we need it for transporting to a place we want to go. Also, using a bike, walking, or skating is a great tool and excercise to our legs to keep our body maintained and healthy.",0
"Limiting car usage can seem like a far fetched idea, but in reality, it helps us more than hurts us. Limiting the usage of cars helps reduce pollution, reduce smog, and reduce the amount of obese people in the world. By doing so, it's not a bad idea to limit car usage.

Pollution, the cause of the ice caps melting, is an ongoing battle that we seem to be losing. As it states in Source One, ""Passenger cars are responsible for twleve percent of the green house gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". If the cities in the United States had these limitations then our percentage woul rapidly decline. In Europe, they have already taken notice of their percentages of pollution and have started to have experimental towns in which there are car limitations put in place. In the town of Vauban, as written in Source One, ""There are only two places to park, the large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space for fory thousand dollars,along with a home"". This is a good way to get rid of all the pollution, by having no where to park and if they want to park, they will have to pay for their space. It also states ""As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there"". The people that live there most of them are carless so they don't spend their money on a parking spot, meanwhile some people sold their cars to either to avoid paying for a spot, or to join in the experiment of limiting the usage of cars.

Smog, is a citafect of to much pollution in one area. Smog has gotten so bad that Paris, accordinto Souce Two, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. The ban was partial as in the article it says "" on Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a twenty-two euro fine (thirty-one dollars) and the next day it would apply to the odd numbered license plates"". This caused almost four thousand drivers to be fined and twenty-seven cars were impounded, acoording to the article. Smog is a problem that can be fixed just like how Paris got rid of their smog by car usage limits.

Car limitations don't just help the enviroment they can help us as well. Humans have become very obese in the last fifty years then they have been in any other time period. You can blame the fast food, but you can eat fastfood and stay healthy. Car limitations make you walk or ride a bike which can get you healthier. I'm not saying go out and be Usain Bolt or Lance Armstong but it can help people to be healthier at the same time as being helpful to the enviroment.

Car usage limitations are a great idea, although most people wouldn't enjoy it. It helps reduce pollution which is the biggest threat globaly. It helps dissolve smog from highly car populated areas. The limits can even help humans by having them ride bikes or walk. The thought of limitations are not accepted by most people but if this is what we must do to keep the earth healthy then we have to do it.",0
"They say the facial expressions for each emotion are universal because even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, the new emotion are facial movements for example the painted face from the Mona Lisa, we can identify a lot emotions as Vinci's masterpiece. Each expression is a neutral face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,sad,etc.

imaginate if the computer know when your happy or sad, that well be so cool, then you know if someone is sad and you can help him or you can know if this person is happy and he make you happy two, the can be great to create new stuff like videogame tv show and all kinda things, most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotionalcomunication, so that mean the computers have to understand that too, sometimes not only moving your facial muscles make make you express your emotion but that maybe make you feel them,making that can reveal sabout the science of the emotions.",0
"Votes for the president of the United States are counted each election in two ways, the popular vote and the Electoral College. The popular vote is the people's vote, which allows our democratic nation to vote for their leader themselves, and the Electoral College is dependent upon the popular vote, and casts electoral votes based on the number of Representatives and Senators each state has in Congress (Source One). People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process, due to the fact that the people's votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this, many people want the Electoral College to be gone, and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic nation, the current electoral voting process may not represent the popular vote, and it's a more fair system.

As citizens of the United States of America, we depend on the fact that we live in a free nation that values our justice, liberty, and voice. Included within our voice, we also depend on our democracy, that allows us to have say in who runs our country and how. It's important that we take advantage of this voice we have in the government, and it's also important we are represented fairly within it. When we depend on electors from the Electoral College to vote for who our states popular votes went to, they may not be doing that. They ultimately can decide who they are voting for, and if they decide to vote for the opponent, no one can stop them. It's very easy for them to betray our trust without our awareness (Source Two). Source Three also states that ""that trust is rarely betrayed,"" which makes it clear that although uncommon, there have been incidents in the past where the citizens have been represented unfairly. In a democratic nation, we should have true sovereignty and be able to cast our popular vote, and know that it is being counted and included in the final say of our leader.

Overall, the Electoral Vote may not represent the Popular vote. As mentioned, there have been incidents in the past that have indicated the truthfulness of this statement. For example, in 1960 John F. Kennedy was almost opposed by unfair elections due to our country's people being misrepresented (Source Two). Even if the popular vote of our state goes one way, the ""'faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Source Two). The electors are unreliable and may go one way just because they please to do so while leaving the faithful citizens in the dust with their decisions and votes meaning nothing. The popular vote system would better represent the people than the unreliable Electoral College system we have now.

The popular vote system is a more fair system, one of many reasons being that it would eliminate the advantage large and ""swing"" states have over others. Currently, ""swing"" states are being given more attention to be the candidates because the candidates realize that the fate of their presidency may be dependent upon these states (Sources Two and Three). Since the Swing states are the ones who's votes can go either way, the candidates spend more time with these states in order to insure their likelihood to achieve the states electoral votes. This is not a fair process because the other states are not getting to know the candidates like these states do. The same thing goes for large states. Since the number of electoral votes you have is dependent upon population, the larger states have more electors/representatives. Therefore, the presidential candidates want to achieve as many electoral votes as possible and will make sure to appeal to the larger states, leaving the smaller states at a disadvantage due to misrepresentation. The popular vote system would take everyone into account evenly, and therefore represent everyone fairly, and make for a better voting system.

All in all, the current Electoral College system is unfair, misrepresented, and unappealing to a democratic nation. The system should be abolished for all of these reasons, and allow the popular voting system to come in to play. The popular vote system would allow each citizen to be represented equally, and create a more level and fair environment. It's important that a democratic nation feels like one, and that we are all represented fairly, and there's no better way to do so than by being our own representatives.",0
"Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughtout the years, different countries have incouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their ""goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Other places, like Paris, banned driving to ""clear the air of the global city."" This is due to ""days of near-record pollution."" The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Also, businessman, Carlos A. Plaza, said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. When you don't drive, you don't have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams, you won't be mad because someone just cut you off, or that the teenage girl in front of you isn't paying attention because she is talking on the phone and doing her mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street, you will realize how stressful driving can be.

In conclusion, driving only causes air pollution and more stressfull days. Walking, riding a bike, or riding the bus not only saves money, but it also helps the environment and makes you a happy person.",0
"Dear Senator,

Its official, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, ans irrational.  A direct election would make it fair to most states and it wouldnt matter on the amount of electors.

The electoral college depends on the popular vote so the you are only voting for the electors not the actual canidates if you think about it.  Each states gets a certain amount of electors depending on the population of that state.  For example,

California gets 55 electors while Florida only gets 29.  So the presidents wont eben care to show up to places Alabama with only 9 electors.  They would only go to the bigger populated states and try and win their votes and not worry about the rest of the country.

If we had a direct election more of the people vote would count and it wouldnt matter about the electors in the states.  The citizens would actually be voting on the canidates.  This is a much more fair system to include everyone into and have an accurate election.

In the end, you should realize how uneccessary the electoral college is and how the direct election is a more fair way to get accurate results.  This way we would have much less issues and the elections would take place in all states and not just the ones with more electors.",0

"Receiving advice from others is like having someone else pick out your clothes; a weight is being lifted off you shoulders. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, for they will receive advice from others with more experience, it will help them grow as a individual, and it will be an eye opener to their situation.

To begin with, asking others for advice can benefit one in many ways. The person who they may be asking may be more experienced in the subject and help them out with their situation. For example, Generic_Name just began attending a new school. He has tried his best to make friends but he has failed. Generic_Name, very discouraged, decided to ask his mom for some pointers on how to make friends. When he got home from school he went right into the kitchen to ask his mom for some help. His mom simply said, ""Be yourself, they will come around, trust me."" Generic_Name was frustrated because he was being his self but they just looked at him like he was an alien. He knew it was time to turn to his older sister, Generic_Name. Later that evening when Generic_Name came home from basketball practice he knew it time to ask her what to do. After she had gotten settled he went into her room knowing she was his only hope. Generic_Name told him that, ""You are the new kid, fresh meat. Give them a break and do not try as hard to want their attention. The best way to gain someones attention is to not want it."" After doing exactly what his sister said to do, two of the boys from his gym class came and sat beside him at lunch. Generic_Name could have just went with his moms advice, but after talking to his sister he has now made two new friends.

Also, asking the advice of others helps one to grow. When someone asks for help they tend to remember how to deal with those specific situations later on in life. For instance, Generic_Name is struggling in her math class. Every time the class has a test she always finishes first, that is why she does not understand why her grades are not good in Ms. Generic_Name's math class. She told Generic_Name, ""I do not get it, I always finish my work first! I do not understand why I continue to get bad grades in here."" Ms. Generic_Name told her that, ""Not everything is a race Generic_Name. The test are not timed so there is no need to rush."" Generic_Name was very confused, she did not understand she thought if she finished fast that meant because she was so smart and did not need the extra time. When Generic_Name came to class the next day she asked her friends how they get such good grades on the test and they all said in a cautious tone, ""Read the questions carefully! Ms. Generic_Name is always trying to trick us."" When Ms. Generic_Name entered the classroom she announced to the class that they had a pop quiz. Generic_Name still thinking of what her teacher and friends told her took her time on the pop quiz and earned an ninety five percent. Generic_Name was so proud. From now on Generic_Name knew that in order to make good grades she would have to just slow down a bit and take her time. Like Ms. Generic_Name said, ""Slow and steady wins the race, or in this case receives a good grade.""

In addition, taking the advice from others can help one to see the situation from a different point of view. Sometimes a person looking from the outside in on the situation may just help find a solution to it. Specifically, Generic_Name and Generic_Name have been best friends for forever and they do everything together. Every summer Generic_Name and Generic_Name go to basketball camp together but not this year. Generic_Name just got excepted into the Generic_City Summer Science Camp she has been trying to get into since the first grade. Generic_Name was so excited she had to call up her best friend Generic_Name and tell her the great news except Generic_Name did not think it was so great. When summer came around for the first time they had to go their separate ways to different camps. Generic_Name was really mad but she still missed her best friend the whole summer. Generic_Name, on the other hand was loving science camp she wrote to Generic_Name everyday trying to see how she was doing and telling how the great time she was having. Generic_Name decided that she was not going to write Generic_Name back in return of her just up and leaving her for science camp. When the girls returned back to school Generic_Name ignored Generic_Name which left her sad and confused. Generic_Name had no idea why she was acting that way she decided to ask their other friends if any of them knew why Generic_Name was acting that way but no one knew. When Generic_Name got home for her first day back to school she was greeted by her mom who was now confused as to why she looked so upset. She shared with her mom what was going on and her mom knew exactly what was wrong with Generic_Name. ""Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name's mom said, ""She may be hurt because you left her you two do everything together."" Generic_Name now realizing what she had done ran up the steps and immediately called Generic_Name and apologized. Generic_Name was happy that her mom talked to her or she might have lost her best friend. That just goes to show that sometime having another person view the situation can help come up with a better solution.

However, some people feel that taking the advice from others is useless. They feel that solving their own problems helps them become a stronger individual. Other may not like everyone being in their business because they may be a more private individual. Getting advice from other may not be the best thing because some people feel they know what is right and may think they know how to fix the situation but they do not. On the contrary, I feel that asking others for advice is a great idea.

In conclusion, these are all reasons why everyone should ask more than one person for advice. The way it builds one character. Prepares them for the real world. It is always a good idea to get an outsiders opinion. Like my mom always says, ""It never hurts to ask for help.""",0
"Use of technology has been changed over the past decade. Technology has been grown a lot. People use technology in regular basis. The article, Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of technology to read peoples emotions. This idea is very helpful and can use in any places like hospitals, schools, etc. Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable due to it's ability to recognize need of help, to get desirable results, and to save time.

First reason why using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, is due to it's ability to recognize need of help. According to the article, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored."" The author meant to say that the emotion reader has the ability to recognize a emotion. Using this emotion reader in classroom computer, it is easier to identify whether a students need help or not. Due it's ability to recognize need of help, classrooms should have the technology to read the emotional expressions of students.

Second reason why using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, is due to it's ability to get desirable results. According to the article, ""If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" The author meant to say that this emotion reader has the ability to find what an individual like or not by just looking at that individual's face. Due it's ability to get desirable results, classrooms should have the technology to read the emotional expressions of students.

Final reason why using technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable, is due to it's ability to save time.

""It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The author meant to say that the, this emotion reader have the ability do the job of a teacher. While the teacher is busy, the computer can help the student identify what they need help with. This save a lot of time of both the students and the teachers. Due to it's ability to save time, classrooms should have the technology to read the emotional expressions of students.

Due to the ability of recognizing need of help, getting desirable results, and saving time, technology should be used in classrooms to read the emotional expressions of students. Now technology has the ability to recognize whether an individual need help or not. It can give the results that an individual like by identifying their emotion. It can save a lot of time for both students and teachers by doing the work of a teacher and helping the student. Technology has been greatly influenced people over the past decade.",0
"What would I say if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, when I don't? I would first off say they're are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. The only evidence we have are pictures that people send in of ""UFOs"" or ""aliens"" being spotted. Seriously those pictures could be easily edited with the power of the internet.

The Face is just a natural landform! The Face, like many other landforms, looks (hince the name) like a face! Have you ever past by a hill, rock, or any other landform that kind of looks like a human or any other human part? If you have than you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you start thinking ""why does it look ike that?"" or ""what if someone's body is buried there?"".

Although the Face looks like a face, it may have not been built by aliens. Like NASA said when they unveiled the image for everyone to see, it's just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."". The Face was just formed by shadows and your eyes playing a little trick on you.

We don't have enough evidence to prove that aliens created this, so it's much better if we stick to my idea. It's all the work of your eyes, shadows, and the form of the rock. If only we could go to Mars and figure out the truth.",0
"I agree with this statement, because a positive attitude helps you cope more easily with the daily affairs of life. It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. If you adopt it as a way of your life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more succesful.

Whith a positive attitude you see the bring side of life, become optimistic and expect the best to happen. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing.

Also a positive attitude leads to happiness and sucess and can change your whole life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your enviroment and the people around you.

If this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. I'ts as if you radiate light around you.

When you are positive, you tend to pull yourself out of negative loop and don't lose focus from what you really want to achieve, the person with a positive attitude has a better perspective of life. understand that is important to take resposibility for one's actions for example: problems in your work, family, school etc. A strong sence of responsibility always envokes positive and constructive actions. A positive thinker is never impulsive, they always wait to get clarity of a particular situation.

Being positive and calm always enable you to see both sides of the coin.

Positive attitude is the key to sucess in lifen because if you are positive you will belive and trust yourself, and you won't let negative people affect your deams, if not you will work hard until you get them and go will sucessful.

"the author of the story says that venus is very worthy pursuit because it is the closets to earth. What he means by saying closest is terms like density and size of venus is the same of earth. The author also says venus is our planetary neigbor. Venus does orbit the sun at diffrent speeds then us so that could be a diffulcty for us to get to venus to. we usaully are closer in time to mars then we are to venus at times.

Humans have already tried landing diffrent types of of space crafts to venus. those space crafts have all failed or have not survived more then a couple of hours on the surface. It would be very hard to survive in venus because of its condition its covered by blankets of corbon dioxide, clouds are corrosive sulfiric acid, 800 degrees weather, and the pressure is 90 times greater then earths. but venus could have all been eath like at one point. Venus could have been covored in oceans and supported many forms of life. scientist want to make blimp like cars so the humans that are sent to venus wouldnt have to touch the ground of all those gases.

This is why scientist think it a worthy pursuit to keep studying venus. they are getting closer and closer to overcoming this challange. they have allot of options on how to survive on venus. Once they get it it can help us with allot of things. thats why scientist wont stop studying venus.",0
"I think theat limiting car usage in some cities and towns can be a good thing. It can be helpful because with less cars on the road that means less trafic on the roads. It is also helpul because if your need to get somewhere, now you can walk, run, or bike ride there.

Limiting cars on the road can help public transportation get to their destination faster because there is less trafic. With less cars on the road in helps the Planet by comsuming fuel. By driving your car around the citie, it causes pollution to be in the air, the same air we breathe. According to the article, in some cities like Paris and Bejing, they baned driving your own car due to the pollution it releases in the the atmosphere. If you are caught driving your own car out in pulic you can get finned and even towed away.

In addition to limiting car usage, it can benefit you getting some exercise. To get to places, you would either have to ride a bike or walk there. It can help you loose weight or to get your cardio vascular system going and ready for the day. Even if your destination is far away, you would have to walk to the bus stop, even just a short little walk everyday for many days can help your fitness, and can keep you healthy.

In conclusion, Limiting usage of cars is helpful to the environment and also to your fitness, keeping cars off the road for public transportation the get to destionations quicker.",0
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

He includes everything that the planet itself would benefit from it and the humans on earth.

He explains what evidence we could find, what we could explore and what may be out there that we do not know is in existance.

In paragraph 3 he says, "" these conditions are far more extreme than anything humas would encounter on earth"".

This shows that if we were able to land on Venus and actually get to explore than we could possibly figure out why Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our Solar System.

We could also explore the additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes on Venus.

In paragraph 4 it says that Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our Solar System.

This just proves the authors point more that studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers because we could figure out how Venus was/is much like Earth and what they had/have in common. NASA already knows that there are still some features that are analogous to those on Earth such as a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountians and craters.

So by studying Venus we could know more in depth about these analogous features.

NASA has gone as far as finding substitutes for landing on the planet so we can still explore it.

This just goes to show how important it is to study Venus.

However doing so our research and evidence would not be as sufficient as it would if we could land on the planet.

If we did not land on the planet we could not collect samples of rock, gas, take close up photos, etc.

So in conclusion, it is very important that we study Venus not only because it is the most Earth like planet out there after Earth itself but also because it would bring much benefit.

It would bring benefit to the planet itself, but also to humans on Earth.

We are curious about what could be out there that we have not yet to explore.

Studying Venus would give us the answers we need and would meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0
"A person who thinks that the Face on Mars is a alien is not right because I the scientist knows that it's not aliens because we have research on it. Even though it may look like an ailen it's not, it is just a natural landform.

In papragraph seven it states on April 5 1998 that the scientist took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Alo it revealed on a JPL web site that it was just a natural landform. Also that there was no alien monument after all.

If the person who still thinks it was created by aliens is stupid because NASA has proof the it is a natural monument. I would show them the photos and have proof that it was. Anyways they would be able to see it way better in the picture and see that i was right.

In paragraph 12 it says that the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ""The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, a face created by aliens and put on Mars is unrealistic. It had to be God or just a natural lanfrom. NASA has proved it in 2001. They also have pictures of the landform. Therefroe it was not aliens.",0
"The author describes how a new technology called, ""The Facial Action Coding System,"" (FACS), enables computers to identify human emotions, by describing the software used at the University of Illinois. I believe this type of technology is a great way to read students' emotional expressions for not only educational use but for human interactions.

FACS would be put into great use of technology for students' due to the amount stress, and confussion students' may be recieving, while doing assignments or assessments. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" (6) This type of technology, could provide a tutor to appear on the screen, and help the student with anything they are in need of. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (6) This may also result in ways students may accumulate these skills during musicals or plays.

Another way FACS could be used, is for human interactions. This may be useful for: family matters, employment, interviews, meeting someone. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (3) This can help tell the person whether they are happy, sad, confused, dishonest, etc. and give the person a way to respond to the situation such as a lie. ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot whena a ""smiling"" polotician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" (8)

In concluding my arguement as to why I agree with the type of technology, FACS, are due to the use for educational purposes such, as being confused on a assignment or assessment, and the use for human interactions whether it is on employment, interviews, meeting someone, or family matters.",0
"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"".

Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didn't like or didn't want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldn't have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they?

Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but won't read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what you're ordering comes with.

Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because they're hurting badly and doctors will say you're perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you don't need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist don't believe in that but most do.

So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes don't know what they're doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",0
"When people ask for advice they are asking for you to tell them something that is better fo them. If someone askes you for some or alot of advice, advice can mean many things. When the they ask other people including you that means they need a lot of advice for something that is really important in their life.

When you give advice you are making their life better. Sometimes people give you good advice and some give you advice that does'nt work out or go out well. When you give them good advice it can make their life better and brings more love in your life or people you really care about.

If you dont give people you are giving advice to, your right opinions or words you will say it can get them really sad and hurt if they mess up and they have no one to love in their life. They might hate you cause you were the one they were listening too. Then they can't trust other people cause you gave them bad advice that could have got them what they wanted.

Bad advice, when someone gives you something that is not good for your health or your brain. You can give someone bad advice around people and they might follow your footsteps and do what you said and that can get them hurt or heartbroken cause you gave them the wrong advice.

Giving other people advice can help them out by giving them your honest opinion about your thinkiing of what you said. Then those people or person can get them in a better life or get them a job that they really want. advice is something that people give you on a daily bases, and advice can get them to a better place or more things that they want for their family and their friends, advice is all aorund us.",0
"Studying Venus is a very worthy pusuit. To study Venus we could learn so much more information than we already have. Venus is said to be the closets realtion to Earth but we cant prove that unless we go explore it.

In the Article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author describes Venus as a very dangerous place full of many challenges that could extreamly hurt anyone trying to explore it. Venus has challenges like air pressure, heat, earthquakes, lighting strikes to probes, volcanos, storms, radiation, and highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds. The heat on the surface of the planet is said to be close to 800° Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greater than it is on Earth. Because of these factors it is almost immposible to be explored by any human.

Venus should still be explored because there are so many things we need to find out about it. The planet Venus ""might have at one point been the most earth like planet in our solar system""(paragraph 4). This is something that would be extreamly important to find out since is could have recources like water and minerals living on the surface. It is also not for sure but ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""(paragragh 4). This is something that could help scientist to determine if or what life forms could have one survived there. This could also help scientists figure out how other planets eco-systems work and thrive.

Although that would be great to find out, the dangers are so high on the planet that it would be almost impossible to figure out. However, some solutions are there. one solution would be to ""allow scientists to float above the fray""(paragraph 5). This means scientist and explorers would float about the clouds and the surface of Venus and examine it from the top. Doing this would keep everything away from the person and make their travels safer. At that level ""the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth""(paragraph 5). The dangers from the air would be significantly less than that at surface level. This is a very plausable solution that would help us explore and keep science safe.

Venus is a planet that needs to be explored despite the dangers. It would be very profound to science and would help us understand how it use to be in the past, as well as how it has changed over hears. It would be a risky mission but thanks to science and engineering there are always possible solutions to keep everyone semi safe and explore all that we can.",0
"The idea of reducing car usage is a good idea, because the environment would be a better place. Limiting cars will not only benefit us with the idea of air pollution but with obesity, and obesity is a big thing in the United States. Its amazing how may people care about there environment. In source 3, Bogota, Colombia millions of columbians hike, bike, skate, or took buses to work during a day they call carfree day because they want to reduce air pollution.

In the United States one out of every 4 person is obese, and the reduction of car usage will help limit the obesity rate. Walking or even biking from one place to another is a work out and that is a common way to lose weight. We try so hard to reduce obesity and one of the many ways to gain weight is to eat junk food and not jog, run, or walk it off. So reducing the limit of cars is a good idea to reduce the obesity rate in the United States.

The reduction of cars will help the air polluting situation in the U.S. The pollution in the air will later in the future bit us right on the rear end. Many people may believe its happening now. The main cause of air pollution is the fuel we have running on our cars that are on the road 247. If we limit the usage of cars now we will start to see the difference in our world today.

Many people dont really use cars in the United States in source 4 it states that study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between the years of 2001 and 2009. It also stated that in 2005 the number of miles driven dropped steadily. Each year in America people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by a recent studies found. So believe or not not many people don't need a car to get to point A to point B.

As of today we should make a effort to stop using our cars and maybe walk to work and get your exercise for the day while doing it. Let make a change together and stop the mass of air pollution we have going on and and reduce the rate of obesity. Lets make our country a better place to be.",0
"Much like the strike of a cobra, cellphones seemingly hit and instantly impacted the world. Their prevalence in today's society is undeniable and has become one of the world's most widespread tools. Their knack-like size employs their use at almost all times, allowing their beholder to multitask while using the device. This one small trait is the very essence of people's disagreement with them. Many people stand against using cellphones and driving as this creates a problem for all drivers near and far. Cellphones should not be used while driving if you wish to be able to use it again.

The age of cellphones started, what seems like, yesterday and they had already grabbed the public's eye. They allowed people to stay in touch even when the ones they wish to touch aren't near by. This very reason is what created the epidemic and addiction to cellphone, connection. The connection across all boundaries is what's gotten so many people glued to their cellphones. People nowadays can't go 10 minutes without checking their phones. Almost everywhere you go, phones-phones-phones, their everywhere, in people's hands, to people's ears, in their pockets, their unavoidable. It's even gone so far that many professionals have begun questioning if cellphone addiction is real.

Another major part of the problem is teenagers. As teenagers began to transition into the real world, some the first things they get are cellphones and their driver's license. The phone almost always becomes an attachment. Along with the freedom to drive, this creates problematic gaps in society. Many teens are not the most focused individuals. They are often guided by impulse rather than intellect, and the simple beep of a text message is just the right impulse. A simple ""L.O.L."" is all it takes to ruin their young lives. A few short words could potentially take the premature life of someone all because there hasn't been any real steps taken to not allow this.

In conclusion, cellphones' grasps on the world is one that is hard to deny or shake. Many individuals have even become addicted to their devices. This addiction has caused a grave number of problems for the world such as accidents, car wrecks and even death in some cases. These tragedies have heavily impacted our youth as they are some of the most at risk an afflicted. These young people are our next generation and we should try our best to protect and guide their lives to the greatness they can achieve. Therefore, cellphones should not be used while driving.",0
"For example, some simplifed eclctronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers exiting in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronis at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to tablet to acid or heat capabel of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our tavels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

It still important in those day , learning about Venus and what is near by our human world .So, we should keep learn about NASA.",0
"The electoral college should be stopped. The electoral college takes away peoples rights.

The electoral college takes away from peoples rights. The people of the United States should be the one who decides what our president, not our senators. The votes that us citizens put in should be counted and not the senators votes. In my opinion, it should not matter what the size of the state/population for a number of votes to be put out. In the end we are all a whole. If youre voting for the president, why would you vote for the slate of electors?

A big argument there is, is called the disastor factor. Some electors have refused to vote for a certain candidate. This is why the people should take responsibility and vote. There is also less likely to be a tie if you let the people vote for the president and not the slate of electors. There is an even number of people so there could be a tie at any point. The state population shouldnt depend on how many representatives are given to the House of Representatives.

As to the candidates, they cannot spend time in states they have no chance in winning in. They mostly worry about the 'swing' states because either one could win in it. But it shouldnt be up to the slate of electors, but up to the people.

Maybe one day this electoral college will be abolished, but until then we have to live with it. It should be up to the people and not the states. It is unfair to the candidate and the people of the United States.",0
"Careers are a big part of a person's life. People can choose from thousands of careers that interests them. Careers usually tell a person's personality. A lot of people take careers very seriously and want to know more about careers. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like, they will find something fun to do everyday, and they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives.

Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like. Some students lack information about becoming a doctor. Students often don't know what it is like to become a doctor, or know the basics. In order for students to obtain information and knowing how to treat a patient, they need to experience it physically. It is a good idea for students to take action in a career because they will get more information about it. In addition to knowing what is like to become a doctor, students can look up a career they want to know more information about. For example, if a student wants to know more information about dentistry, they can easily research what do you need to do to become a dentist. Students should engage in a career early because they can find a lot of resources to get there.

A second reason students should be in a career early is because they will find something fun to do. Most students don't really do anything after school or in their free time. The students who don't take action in doing anything, will more likely become miserable and bored. For these students the only thing they should do is join in after school program that helps and educates students about careers. Students should be involved in a career at a young age because a lot of students don't know what to do in their free time. Also, students don't really have a hobby they can do. Students sometimes don't really think about having a hobby that can keep them happy. Students can find that hobby by taking part in a career and actually find something that really interests them.

Students need to be in a career at a young age because they will find something that is important to them.

A final reason students should commit to a career early is because they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives. Most teens don't know what they wanna do later on as they become adults. These people usually struggle in finding a job, and also getting that job. If a student spends extra amount of time in school reading and getting information about a career, they won't have that problem later on. In fact they will easily know what they want to do. Students who get into a career at a young age won't have any problems in finding a job later on. In addition to finding a job, students as they get older won't have any stress on what they want to be. When students graduate high school they are pressured in finding a job, which makes them really stressed. Some students aren't as stressed as others because they already know what interests and them and what they wanna be.

If a student who doesnt know at all what they wanna be, they should spend lots of time on researching and attending career based programs to give them an idea or two on what to be. Students should part of a career at a young age because they won't be as stressed.

Some people firmly believe that students should not commit to a career at an early age because they arent well educated about a career. Unfortunately, these students are more likely to have problems later on when finding a job. In order for students to fully know about a job is to take part in a career fair or just overall being in a career so they can be sucessful when doing so. Students should commit in a career early because they will be more educated in a career. In addition to, they will find a hobby in their free time. Finally they won't have any stress or problems later on in finding a job. ",0
"Dear State Senator, we should not keep the Electoral College. I'm in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electorsal college is unfair. It's outdated and irrational. Many people prefer election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. They shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president.

One of my reasons is because under the electorsal college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electorss, who in turn elect for the president. The electorss can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on the state, the electorss are picked by state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. The electorsal college isn't the best way to handle elections because it is the electorss who elect the president, not the people, which to me sounds unfair. Voters can't always control who their electorss will vote for and voters do get confused sometimes about the electorss. So if you really agreed on one president, chances are that might not be the president who's gonna be elected because the electorss can choose the other person running for president instead.

The electorsal college is unfair. The electorsal college consists of 538 electorss. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the president. Richard Nixo, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agreed on abolishing the electorsal act. According to a gallop poll in 2000, over sixty percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Voters don't want the popular vote winner to lose the presidency but because of the electorsal college it can happen. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electorss.

Lets say that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electorss. Those electorss can always defy the will of the people. Faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they pleased. Why on earth would they do such a thing. They should care about what voters believe in. In 1960, people who favored separation based on race in the Louisiana legislature nearly actually succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss so that they would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means the popular votes would not have actually gone to Kennedy. That is not fair. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

State Senator, I'm in favor of changing to election by popular votes because it's fair. The electorsal college should stay in the past and should'nt be used anymore. The best way is for the election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and decided to vote for whoever they wanted. Selfish much? People shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president. These electorss should consider what the people want. I believe Elections by popular votes for president of the united states is the best option.",0
"I believe that the possible use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is indeed valuable because it can really change how teachers teach the lesson plan, by showing which students auctually know what they're doing and which students are confused. It can also show which students are board and lets teachers know that they need to make the lesson more interesting.

But I do believe that it can go farther than just the class room, the school counclers can use this to tell if someone is having issues or just a bad day. If the student is upset or angry, the counclers could help them by just knowing how they feel. It can also allow the resource room teachers to better understand how their students are feeling and how to help them.

This could help teachers ease up on the work load given to students by showing them how stressed some students are when given a lot of homework, and it can tell teachers when a student is not paying any attention. This can rebuild the relationship between students and teachers by allowing teachers to better know their students needs and limits, as in how much homework they can efficiently get done with out stressing about it. This can also help teachers push back tests by knowing who isn't getting it, or having less things on it because the students are understanding the materal.

I honnestly believe that FACS really is valuable when reading the emotional expressions of students in the class room by; telling the teacher who needs help, also telling the teacher who is board and how stressed the students are, by telling the resourceroom what their students are feeling today and how to adapt to that, and by helping the counclers by showing them who needs to get something off their chest.

I really do believe that this will auctually help students and teachers in the very near future.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is better for the environment, it limits time spent sitting in traffic, and saves money.

The main cause of people wanting to limit driving is to protect the environment. According to an article by Elizabeth Rosenthal, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gasses in Europe... and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Emissions from car exhaust is polluting the air and creating smog in large cities. According to Robert Duffer, Paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. Some people want new suburbs to be built specifically to encourage the limiting of driving. Limiting driving does lower the amount of smog and air pollution in cities.

Another benefit of limiting driving is that it limits time spent sitting in traffic. In Bogota, Colombia, a ""carfree day"" was issued. The goal was to reduce smog as well as reduce traffic jams around the city. The reduction of these traffic jams also reduced stress and promoted excessive. People could stop worrying about being late for work because of the traffic. It caused many people to walk or bike to work instead of driving or taking the bus. Another advantage of this is that parks and sports centers have thrived across Bogota. Limiting the use of cars isn't only healthier for the environment but also for us.

One final advantage to limiting the use of cars is that it saves money. Citizens save money by not having to buy cars or the gas they require. Also, citizens don't have to pay taxes for roads, parking lots, or traffic lights. Another way limiting driving saves money is on the materials and equipment needed to pave roads and parking lots. Since many people who live in dense cities take the subway or bus to work anyway because of the recent recession, limiting car use would be an easy way to clean up some pollution in that city.

In conclusion, limiting driving has many big advantages. It protects the environment while limiting traffic in cities, encouraging excessive, and saving money. I'm not sure how it would work out here because of how spread out everything is, but it sounds like a great idea in a dense city.",0
"In 1976 , there was a ""Face"" dicovered on Mars. There is proof that it is there! As of the pictures taken in 1976, 1987, and 2001 .

Many say it has looked like an Egyptian Pharoh. Some agree , and some don't . But whatever it is, it has grabbed the attention of the world !

The Mars ""Face"" Has become a huge pop icon ! In the story it says, it has starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books and magazines, it has even been on radio talk shows ! Something on a whole different planet , has the humans on Earth excited ! Wouldn't it be cool to see it in real life?

Some people think it's Bona fied evidence of life on Mars ! Although , very few scientist have believed that the face was an alien atrifact . That would be a surprise to all of us ! Even though there have been many theroies of to what it might be , we aren't qutie sure. One day , I'm sure there will be more research done for the ""Face"".

NASA has mentioned that even though there are pictures, they actually don't pass the ""Face"" very often . I wonder what it might look lke from different angles of pictures. The pictures have been taken on different occasions , but sometimes the face is hard to find . Also , there have been slight changes, not surprisingly, because the pictures are years apart ! I can't wait until they take more !

What is the pictures actually showing us ? In conclusion , it shows Martain eqivalent to Messa , or Butte . Those are landforms common around the American West . For many people it reminds them of the ""Snake River Plain of Idaho"". What does it remind you of ?",0
"In Vauban, Germany many people have given up thier cars.

Residents saying that they find that there are many advantages to not owning a car. Such as reducing the gas emissions from tailpipes, saving money, and being much happier.

For instance, an advantage of not having a car is a decrease in gas emission. In the article ""Car Free Cities""  its sites ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United Stated."" This shows that cars are infecting our greenhouses with gases and potentionaly harming us.

Furthermore, not owning a car will save you money. In the article it states ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" That statement shows that it's not really reasonable to own a car when you have to pay to park.

Lastly, people in the article say they are much happier after they sold thier car to live there. There a woman named Heidrun Walter who says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this statement shows that residents of Vauban like separating suburban life from auto use.

To conclude, there are many reasons why the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up there cars. They benefit from many advantages such as reduced gas emissions, saving money, and being much happier in their life. in the end there many advantages to living in Vauban.",0
"We should use this tecnology in kids classroom. In the text it states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored', DR Huang predicts. Yes if the computers was like that it would make it eazier on teachers and students because not everyone learns at the same pace and if a student is bored it would change its couse to fit the student. Also in the text it states According to the facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your face mucles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. This means that if your making faces like putting on a fake smile can actually work and make u fell a whole lot beter. This is science and would a fun activitiy for kids. The only downside would be that that is two much time on computers and cell phones which arent good for the kids health but this is a new day and age and its hard to escape technology. To conclude this would be a great experience for kids and it will help all people with expressing their fellings.",0

"Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become an addiction to the human race. We as humans tend to use them for everything in our lives. People use their cell phone for communication, social media, alarms, schedules planning, etc. Often times people are so distracted by their cellular device that people use them at the wrong time. One of those wrong times are when people use their phone while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous for people to use their phone while driving.

There are a lot of issues that can come with using your phone while driving. Others lives are put into danger, fatal car crashes, accidents and using your phone shows that you are willing to risk your own personal safety. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging (teendriversource. org). ""Statistics show that the use of a cell phone behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (teendriversource. org).""

Distractions from cell phones cause death rates to go up. Society has a bad addiction of being on their cell phones for long periods of time. This addiction is causing people to be distracted while driving. Many people have been in car accidents where people were brutally injured and some have had fatal accidents. Not only did the distracted driver hurt the opposing driver but the loved ones of the opposing drive goes through a lot. Their loved one might be hurt and need full time care or they may have to plan a funeral.

Situations like these should make us think about the actions we take. Society should pull away from their phones to save others lives and save heartbreak from others. Most adults think it is the teenagers that are causing the problems with distraction of cell phones. Adults are a big problem when it comes to being distracted with cell phones while driving. However, society should not accuse each other but we should work together on making a change in cell phone usage.

In conclusion, society should take time out and stop being selfish about using their phones while driving. People should stop trying to check their messages, read the latest tweet, or catch up on the latest post on instagram. Society should think about the safety of themselves and the safety of others. Waiting until your next destination to check your phone could help bring down the death rates of fatal car accidents. Our states have laws in place that demand that we don't text while driving. People have bought devices to hold their cell phone on their car dash but that doesn't help. The driver tends to look a the phone instead of the road. They especially look at the phone when making a video call. The purpose of driving is to arrive at our next destination safely. Face to face conversation should be practiced more and that could decrease the use of cellphones while driving. Everyone should stay safe and keep the world safer by focusing on the road and not our cellular device.

"As we all know all of us need some advise at some point in our life. We ask for advise to get through rough times, bad situations, and even life itself. Three main reasons why we ask for advise is because we all have fights in friendships,get into bad relationships,and struggle in school.

First of all, we all have our fights with friends over periods of time. They can happen because both of you could like the same handsome and popular boy in school. Fights with your friends can even happen with liitle things like a disagreement and start to fight over that. It happens it's part of life. Another example is you not going to their birthday party last year and you both stop talking to each other. Make it up to her this year and try to plan to go to that brand new amusment or water park that just opened a few days ago.

Secondly, girls could get into bad relationships and not know what to do. To all of the girls out there we all get into bad relationships. I can tell you I have had many of them in my life. We all fall for that cute,pretty, and sinister smile on their face. I have seen it so many times it's unreal to belive that once we say yes we fall into their plan to take our hearts and just tear them to shreds. Boys can be like that. They plan to trap us and never let us go to see the bright beam of love again. Until you meet another one who is more caring and loving and you start to feel that sensation you used to feel and you know you found the right one.

Finally, we all struggle in school. It's like you try and it's not enough to power through the year you are there. I have been there so many times that I can't count. I struggled in math so much I wasn't passing in that class. It was so hard for me to where I had melt downs and called me stupid and dumb. I was at the point to where I wanted to just give up and quite everything I had done. My mom and dad on the other hand had my back and they still do to this day. They tell me that i'm not stupid and dumb and to just keep trying and to push on and to always look ahead and never look back.

To sum it up, all of us have our bad and good days and that's okay. We all find away to push forward and get through it together. As I said in the beginning we all ask for advise because we all have fights in friendships,get into bad relationships,and even struggle in school. All I have to say is don't stop trying if you don't make it try again and just don't stop fighting.",0
"changing  it from Electroral college to popular is grate idea . it be easay to tell wtich state voted for the president the most also  you don't  have to recount the votes.

the problem with electoral college is that voters dont vote for the president  but a slate of the electors who in turn elect the president .

the electoral  vote caused the 2000 fiasco it was the biggest Election crisis  in a deacades  where  they had to recounnt the stat votes and electors  the system failed to keep count of the votes.

the electors  college is unfair to voters .because of the winner take all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chances of winning .

seventeen states didn't see  the candidates  at all they didn't even get chance to see a single ad about them .

to top it all off changing from electoral to popualr is less hassel and less choas for the people and santes .",0
"My fellow citizens, there are many reasons why we all should depend less on our cars as a way to travel or to get to one place to anouther. One of the many reasons is that there are some neighborhoods that are doing it so that their families can not drive a car and if they do they have to pay money, and there are already many places that are doing car free days or somethimg like that.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal there is a city in germany named VAUNBAN were they can not use cars and if they do use cars then they would have to park it in a place that is very far away and they would have to pay a total of $40,000 to buy that parking space this is better because there are many ways that polution can polute the earth and we do not want that to happen.

Also there are many places that are doing car free days in which the citizens must not use there cars and ride the busses to work so that there izs less polution. this is good because there will be a major decrease in polution which is good for the earth and also good for the soul.

In conclusion i think that there should be less places for cars to drive and polute the world and mother earth and you should to.",0
"I think that the author of The challenge of exploring Venus suggests studying venus is a worthy persuit because he must really intrest him so he wants to share it with everyone else. In the first paragraph the author says that Venus is sometimes called the "" Evening Star "" because it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is offten referred to as Earths twin. Venus is the closest to planet to earth. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus. Venus has the hottest surface surface temperature of any planet in the solar system, even though Mercury is closest to the sun. High pressure and heat, Venusian Geology and weather presents additional impedments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and then also some frequent lightning strikes. Some sientists have benn discussing further visists to the planet. NASA has been working on many other approaches to studying Venus more. People striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. The tarvels on earth and also beyond earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Venus can be very intresting so thats whay I think the auther wanted to write about us and tell us amny good facts about it.",0
"Many people around the world drive vehicles to get from point a to point by. Although this is a good source of personal transportation, it may not bye as favorabyle as people imagine.

Primarily, the decrease in vehicles byeing a source of personal transportation is fairly byeneficial to the environment and ourselves. In fact, this new ""phenomenon"" is happening all over the world. As mentioned in the articles ""In German Subyurby, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", ""Car Free Day is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota"", and ""The End of Car Culture"", many citizens of many different cultures see that the lowered usage of vehicle transportation doesn't only decrease how many greenhouse gasses are getting in the atmosphere byut also improves our wellbyeing byy reducing stress levels. Not only does it help us relieve stress and what ails us byut it also makes the distance we have to travel to purchase food much shorter, as cited in ""In German Subyurby, Life Goes On Without Cars"", giving us the opportunity to restock our supply over time instead of byuying multiple cart loads at once.

Secondarily, according to the article ""The End of Car Culture"", having access to byusses and other pubylic transportation can improve our safety. It is also seen in this article that ""at the Mobyile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford came up with a byusiness plan to create a world where personal vehicle ownership isn't needed or is undesirabyle. His company would partner up with the telecommunications industry to help create new cities and towns in which many ways such as using a byicycle, private cars, commercial and pubylic transportation, and simply walking could bye woven into a connected network."" With this new plan, there would bye improved safety byy having official drivers providing the byus transportation and private car transportation. Both of these ways are liabyle to give us extra time in our days byy decreasing the probyabyility of traffic and will give us ultimate safety while getting from point a to point by.

There are many cultures in our world today who go along with the plan of decreasing the amount of vehicle transportation. There are many different ways this is byeing achieved and every one of us can bye a part of it.",0
"The face can speak more than words. Most communication is nonverbal, its emtional communication. Although we can fake a smile or fake an emotion some people might not catch on, well with new technology computers can now read our emotions. Dr. Huang, has come up with new software allowing computers to read and understand a person's facial expresions. This software allows a new connection to be made with humans and computers; and help each other communicate better. This new technology is a great idea for making our future with technology more enjoyable.

With technology on the uprise in todays age, it is becoming more of a neccessity in our everyday lives. Most schools teach with electronics, many jobs rely on technology, and the average person spends half their day on their phone. This software can make our experiences more enjoyable on electronics, for example ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."". This makes the time spent on computers more enjoyable as we will see more things we like. Not only is it a good idea for consumers, its also a great way for bussinesses to advertise.

In schools it can be hard for kids to enjoy lessons or subjects if they don't undertsand them. If we have computers that could detect the students emotion, then that would better the students learning experience. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" , understanding the students emotions could help their education. As this computer could read if a student is confused or bored, it can just as esaily make the lesson understanable or interactive. With this type of technology it could change the way education is handled all together.

Today's mainstream media is all about faking it until you make it, but with this new technology it won't be as easy to get away with. This software can tell a real smile from a fake smile, it's all about the muscle movements. If it can tell a fake from a real emotion then the media will really crack down on today's mainstream stars and politicians. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebirty isn't being truthful."", this could be a turning point for the media.

With technology becoming more interactive we are going to find new ways to make our everyday life a little easier. Spotting real and fake emotions can be really difficult these days as we have actors and actresses everywhere. It can also be difficult in learning environments, and even our everyday life. This technology can really help us start to understand each other more and make a more personal connection with technology. This great idea can sprout many more technological advances, who knows what else is instore?",0
"Many European countries have been making a move towards limiting car usage in efforts of halting pollution, adding exercise to everyday life, conserve resources, and improve safety for others. An example of this phenomenon is Vauban, Germany, where suburbs are not allowed to drive vehicles. Doing this has helped improve society by bringing people closer to each other and removing the stress of traffic. Other people create a holiday for this, Carfree day, where people can only get around by public transportation and walking. As countries become more organized, there is a lesser need for cars to get around as the city is closing in on us.

Various countries have been making cities more dense and bring stores and businesses closer to neighborhoods, with the idea of Smart Planning. This idea is making communities more compact, like vaughn's 5,500 residents living within a square mile. With this, the need of cars is drastically reduced, creating a stress free environment that is less polluted and clean. Also, to discourage the use of cars, there are only parking garages on the edge of town and barely any parking spots, leaving more room for sidewalks and housing development. People began to walk socialize along the way, allowing exercise and social benefits.

Car pollution has been a major problem ever since the first cars were made. In the Paris, the smog became so thick, they had to partially ban driving. Even license plates one day, the next odd license plates. Congestion was down 60% after 5 days of intense smog. This pollution was due to the French government subsidizing and favoring Diesel fuels. In this time, all public transit were free of charge and people walked to get to where they needed to be. However, delivery companies lost revenue, but exceptions such as plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more people.

In America, the recession has had a devastating effect on some people, many couldn't afford to drive due to gas prices, and sold their cars. ""A study last year has found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009"". This means that Public Transportation, carpooling, and pedestrian are becoming a more commonly used way of getting from A to B, and are more affordable.

Companies like Ford got together at the Mobile World Congress and laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical and undesirable. Their chairman, Bill Ford, proposed partnerships with telecommunication companies. They want to make cities that are more based on pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportion. Doing this, they think it will save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.

The world changes slowly, and these ideas might never catch on. Today, there is a lesser need of cars as cities become more organized and as we start facing an environmental problem. Better city layouts are being made to reduce the need for vehicles by bring businesses closer to neighborhoods. People are sponsoring no car days, smog reduces, and people find that they don't need cars to get around.",0
"I believe the face on Mars was not created by aliens. I believe the face is just a natrual land mass that looks like a face from far away. It's almost as if you were to see a person you think you know, but as you get close enough to see their face you dont know them at all.

I believe the face on Mars is a natrual land mass for many reasons. One main reason is that the face is just and elevated area of land. Over the past years many astroids and space debre have hit or landed I could say on Mars. So if astroids landed on the elevated space in places where the eyes, nose, and mouth should be making it look as if a face was on Mars. The article states that the rock formation was as if it was an illusion of the features of a human on the mountain of rock. Another reason is that in the past the ""Face on Mars"" could have been a mountain. Meaning that the winds, dust, and dirt could have worn down the mountain making it into a mesa. The article states that many mesa's have been spotted around Cydonia, making it possible for the ""Face on Mars"" to be just another mesa. The article staes that NASA have taken many pictures of the face and they all revealed ""a natrual landform."" NASA stated that there was no alien monument. Another reason is that Mars used to be an active planet. So if the ""Face of Mars"" used to be a mountain it could have got run down by lava flows in the area. Making it into a landform thta looks like a face.

In conclusion there are many facts and theories about the ""Face on Mars."" People who think the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens will have a much tougher time proving that it was created by aliens. Therefore there is many more facts about the ""Face on Mars"" being a natrual land mass. These are just some of the reasons why I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural land mass.",0
"Ah, the electoral college. Don't you just

LOVE

how irrelevent, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency (Source 2). Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce (Source 2), and abolish the electoral college.

First, and most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters . Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" (Source 2).  If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3). Voters for the electoral college say that people in the swing states are going to pay closer attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters (Source 3),  but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?!

The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. If this is to occurr, then state delegates in the House of Represenatatives decide the President (Source 2). Each state only casts one vote, so the representative from Rhode Island would have just as much to say as the 55 representatives from the state of California (Source 1 and 2). Not only that, but a majority of people vote one party for president and another for Congress (Source 3). There are 538 possible votes in the electoral college (Source 1), so it isn't impossible for a tie to happen. In 1976, if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had switched candidates, there would have been a tie (Source 2).

And finally, the last thing that makes the electoral college as relevant as a new wheel for your horse and buggy is that, it's mind-bogglingly confusing. The electoral college is run by humans, so we must account for human error. The electors are just people chosen by the candidate who don't hold a seat in government (Sources 1 and 2). In 1960, a group of racists in Louisiana almost replaced Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, and he would have lost the election (Source 2). In Hawaii, also in 1960, two slates of electors were sent (Source 3). Faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for anyone else (Source 2).

In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.",0
"One reason people seek different opinions is because some people have different opinions on what people should do. Seeking different people's opinions allows you to get all the information from all sides. If people seek more than one person's advice then you would be able to compare the information to see what you think is the best choice. Also, if people seek more than one person's advice then the person might be able to collect all the information and put it together.

Another reason people ask different people is because the first person may not be giving you the best advice. Like, what if the first person's advice is pretty good, but then the next person you ask has better advice. If the person asked advice from more than one person then you wouldn't have to be stuck with the bad information. If you just ask for one person's advice and it was bad advice then it could get you in really big trouble. Like, if you rely on one person's advice and they told you that if they start making you mad then you can put your hands on them. What if the person you put hands on presses charges then you could go to jail for a long time. If you asked another person's opinion then you may not be in the situation that you are in.

The next reason why people ask different people for adivce is because if the advice the person gave you worked for them, but it didn't work for you. Like, if a person is having trouble with their dog alerting them that they need to use the restroom. So that their dog doesn't keep going to the restroom in the house. They might say ""you could give your dog a treat when they alert you they need to go to the restroom"". If that doesn't work, but you only asked one person for advice. Then, you would be mad because the advice didn't work. Next, you would have to ask another person for advice, but at the beginning if you would have just asked more than one person then you would be able to peice the information together.

Finally, if people ask more than one person's advice then it will help you make the best choice possible.",0
"Dear my Senator, whats the point in voting if our vote may not even count?

In the Electoral college people citizens vote for a slate of electors who then later go and vote for president. However, sometimes it doesn work that way. The electors are not obligated to choose the president that the people want. The Electoral college is corrupt and needs to go away.

The people of America dont like the Electoral college and want something new. Stated in source 2, "" gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now."" In short, people were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. people would rather have direct voting than to continue with an Electoral college.

The Electors in the Electoral college arnt always innocent. They can lie, cheat, they go behind the backs of the states citizens and not even vote for who the citizens want. In 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with people who would oppose John F Kennedy. source 2, number 11 says ""In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."" This means that with an Electoral college, the person you want to vote for may not even get picked cause of lying electors.

Even though the electoral college is a pretty bad thing, there are still a few upsides. The Electoral college avoids te problem of neither candidates getting a majority of the votes. In source 3, number 22 There is no pressure for runoffelections when no candidatewins a a majority the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariable produces a clear winner... Simply this says that without the electoral college voting can be difficult and stressful.

In conclusion, The Electoral college may not be the best thing for our society, and also can we even trust that our votes even matter? either the Electoral college cant be trusted and it needs to be gone for good, or something needs to change.",0
"I think this technology which is called the '' Facial Action System'' is valuable because it would help out teachers and students.

i think it would be cool if the technology really do can read students feelings because it would be really helpful for teachers. It is because when students are in bad mood teachers don't understand it so having the technology would help the teachers know that he or she is not in a good mood. Those are the reasons why the technology could do this. In paragraph 8 it said that when you have a false smile you can tell because the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle the risorius which is called the orbircularis oculi pars palpabraeus. In a real smile the zygomatic major which is the muscles that begin at your cheeks bones that lift the corners of your monuth. In 6 paragraph it said that the computer can determine how you feel. for example if you smile then the web ad appears on your screan and if you frown the next ad will be different. it also said that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. In that same paragraph it said that the same technology can make a computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery alos it said that most humans communtication is nonververbal including emotional communication.",0
"Our country, the United States of America, needs and deserves a grand president who will work hard and inspire the citizens of this country to persevere like our forefathers have and this president needs to be voted by popular vote by hisher citizens in the United States. The presidential elections need to be of popular vote and to be voted by the citizens of America, not by some electoral college. The reason for this is that for one: the candidates ignore the smaller states, two: electors who are chosen can, and possibly will, go against the will of the people the Electoral College shows signs of inequality amongst the states, unpatrioticism, and unfairness.

If we continue to go by the electoral college, the smaller states who hold inadequate populations will continue to be ignored by the candidates running for presidency. In source 1 paragraph No. 3, it states:""Your states allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives and 2 for your Senators."" Also, in paragraph 13 of Source No.2, it states,"" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" So, the candidates ignore the smaller states because of their smaller population and this is a sign of unfairness and inequality amongst the people of America. The future president should address and obtain votes that are from all 50 states of the United States. That is how we treat and show that every person and every state are equal to one another, and that the candidates get an honest and fair vote. The way the Electoral College does things during the presidential election is everything against how our country came to be through hardwork, a desire and wish to be equal to one another, and to ensure fairness amongst the people this Electoral College projects an unpatriotic feel and that itself should not be a process that the United States holds.

The Electoral College is unfair in the fact that the electors chosen by our state legislature can, and possibly will go against the will of the people. With the Electoral College those who vote aren't actually voting for the president but for a slate of electors that elect the president. In Source No.2 paragraph 11, it states: ""In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This is unfair and a disrespect to a persons choice. It is an act that is untrustworthy and it could happen at any time, people might not even know it. That action practically takes away a citizens right of opinion speech which is part of the Bill of Rights, the very basis of what we have a right to have. That in itself is unAmerican and unpatriotic. This system should be overruled and abandoned for it doesn't go with the basis of our country's ways.

However, the Electoral College does have a somewhat strict rule that is rarely broken. In Source No.3 paragraph 16, it states:"" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for that party's nominee and that trust is rarely broken.."" The Electoral College does have some points that it is not totally untrustworthy. But, this point can be broken and can be unfair for the people.

Senator, I hope these points have shown that the Electoral College needs to be voted against due to its unfairness, unpatrioticness, and its act of inequality amongst the states. This country needs it's people to vote for it's president, not a slate of electors.",0

The way people in vauban chose there lifestyle is starting to rub off on places like europe and the united states. they call it smart planning.

"The Face showing on Mars has been proved to be a natural landform. The Face is a landform because landforms are very common in Cydonia, the only reason the landform looked like a face was because of the shadows visible from the camera, and there was no other evidence found around the face. Also all research for the Face was done by authorized NASA scientists, and the research was believed to be done very carefully.

In Cydonia it is common to have natural landforms, so the Face was easy to be spotted as one. And as the cameras took pictures from different angles, the scientists could see it wasn't anything that spectacular. What made the Face so intresting and made people have false accusations was what made the Face an actual ""face"".

The reason that this lanform resembled a face was because of the shadows. There was shadows on the landform that resembled a head, eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Scientists even stated that the Face ""looked like an Egyptian Pharoah"".

Even if the Face was found to look like something that was a living thing does not have an effect on the research that had been completed on this landform.

To make this statement that the Face is in fact a landform is the amounts of research done by NASA scientists. From snapping numerous pictures to keep resuming to study the Face, NASA has had many ways to prove their point. And after placing the first image on a JPL website, it was settled for most people- the once known as ""Face"" was a natural landform. It was no sign of Aliens or an Alien monument anywhere to be seen on Mars.

And the last statement to be concluded about this discussion is that there was nothing else found near the Face to thinking there is any living activity on Mars. NASA has also concluded from the pictures that there had been no objects in the picture like ""airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks..."" So there had been no activity to prove to be nothing more from just a landform.

In the picture of the Face, it was also evidenced to resemble a mesa or a butte, another kind of natural landform. These kinds of natural landforms were even almost the same height as the Face on Mars. And all of this evidence proved that what used to be thought of as a real face is now catagorized as a natural landform with some shadows that gives it unique look.",0
"Todays society uses automotive vehicles almost everyday. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they wanna go. Smog has been building up from the cars pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people's health, an will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportation less will help everyone an everything in the whole world from humans to the air we breath, from animals to the grass they eat.

However, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an everything out greatly. Banning cars for a day or banning oddnumbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In France they have banned oddnumbered an evennumbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for oddnumbered plates on tuesday."" So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decreasing smog. An it also clears up congestion on the roads.

However, by using automotive transportation less it will improve people's health. Walking, skateboarding, riding bicycles, or running will all improve your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there an it would improve your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. ""In Colombia, a program took place an millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work."" That would greatly take a impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excessive for the day to improve their health.

So, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted so it affects the grass an vegetables that animals an humans consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen so we can continue to breath. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much an also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.

In conclusion, using automotive transportsation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone's health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breath in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 an have dropped stedily since then. People are starting to drive less and less an it is greatly helping the entire world.",0
"Community parks has it all open space, sun ,green grass, tables and a nice setting in general.

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. his sibling are loud he can't focus. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. I hope this helps you with your every day situation.",0
"Has the limitation of humans contact due to the use of technology had positive effects on peopl;s lives . I think should humans has limitation contact because to save their life from destioyrd. In the rest rest of this eassy i will say that why limitation of contact to the use of technoloy is important and has positive effects. Also, limitation of humans contact to the use oftechnology is good for our healt and body. Anyway, what informato can give us technology in our entire life. I will explain why we should have limitation of contact ot using technolohg.

First,Why limitation of contact to the use of technology is important and has positive efects; It seems to me that , when i used to much my phone i feel so pain in my eyes and head because i didn't had limitation of contact to the use of my phone. And phone,computers .... is part of technology to help people contact with each other and we should have limitation of contact to using these techonlogy when we need , we can use technology.

Second, limitation of humans contact to the use of technology good for our health and body because when we use alot our body going to hurt and we always feels sick and we can not eath food as much is we need, feell deperessed.

that's why limitation of humans contact to the use of technology has positive efects. For example some people destoiyerd their eyes because of using to mach technology.

Third,what inforamtion can give us technology in our entire life. technology is the biggest things which is we need in our life to do,technology is not the only using phones, computer, robots.. technology can change our life without technology we can not contact the world with humans and information about world.

In conclusion, i have to sat that has humans limitation of contact to use technology because has positive efects. We have take care our healt and body to save from dengeours happening with technology. In additaion, techonloy has alot information which is we need for now, past and for our future. Finally, in my opnion technology can help us alot in our whole life but, also can destioyrd our life. Every one knows that without technology life is hard but, if we have to save our health aslo.

Street parking and driveways are fobidden in some districts. Germans can buy a large garage that cost $40,000 along with the home. 70% of Vauban's famileis don't own cars and 57% sold their cars to move into that distric.

"Venus is the second planet form our sun, while Venus is simple to see from the distant vantage point we have here at Earth, it has been difficult place to examine closely. Venus is oftern referred as Earths ""twin"" and is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size this is why we should research Venus as a planet more. Venus is also relatively close to us so we should definetly invest more money researching even though there are some problems.

The athor states that Venus has proven many times before that it is not an easy planet to study. Each mission to land on venus was unmanned and for good reason, no aircraft would last more than a few hours. This explains why not a spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Many things contribute to Venus's reputaion as a challenging planet for us humans to study. Some of these things are a thick atmosphere of 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers the Venus, even more challenging are the clouds of extremely corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere and on the planets sufare the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atmosphere is 90 tines greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more intense than anything humans can find on earth. An enviroment like venus's Would crush a submarine accustomed to driving in the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy minerals. All these things plus more is why every mission so far has been unmanned, and why there hasnt been a singe spaceship that has landed in Venus in almost 3 decades.

Despite all of the potentially dangerous things about Venus there is still alot to benefit. NASA or The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an compelling idea for sending humans to study the cloudy planet. NASA's possible solution to the hostile condtions on the surface would allow scientists ti float above the fray and study without harm. It's a blimp like vehicle that hovers 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian. Hovering over venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. The author says ""Maybe we should think of them as challenges.""

By the end of the article the author says ""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only becasue of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""",0
"Within the past decade, humans have watched in awe as technology has improved exponentially, and learned to take on tasks once thought only humans could accomplish. Technology has been taught to communicate, entertain, solve problems, along with many other functions, and now it may be able to teach as well. Though we have made use of every technological advancement in the past, this may be one that we should not capitalize on. Before taking this enourmous step in technological advancement, humans must consider the flaws within this newly developed system, and whether we are ready to replace teachers with computers.

Though this new system is an astonishing feat in technology, people muct recognize the flaws within this system as well. As described in paragraph 6, a students facial expression has the power to change a lesson. If this is true, could a student not simply fake an emotion to get out of assignments or slack off by acting confused. The article claims that the software can pick up on fake smiles, but can it detect false expressions for other emotions as well? Another flaw within this system is the emotions the technology is capable of percieving, paragraph 6 disscusses the modification of a lesson based on boredom or confusion detected by the computer, however, neither of these two feelings are listed in the 6 emotions that the software is capable of detecting (paragraph 3). These two major flaws within the software lead to only one conclusion, the technology is simply not advanced enough to take on the role of a teacher.

Humans must also consider this issue from an ethical standpoint, are we ready to take away the role of teachers and replace them with software? Though machines have already taken away menial jobs, such as factory work, teaching is a career which requires a four year college degree and a license. Countless people aspire to become teachers, are we ready to take that away? Even if teachers were to work hand in hand with this technology there would still be flaws. Having a computer read the emotions of a student rather than a teacher would sever immportant student teacher ties, and cheat that student of the oppurtunity of a mentor relasionship. Because people are already capable of reading emotions, it would be foolish to replace that for a less precise piece of equipment. Because of the immportant role of teachers in the lives of students, the push for emotion detecting software in the classroom should be stopped.

Because of the major systematic flaws, and the ethical dilemas accompaniing this issue, it is clear that at least for the time being, the efforts to integrate emotion detecting software into the the cassroom should be put on hold. Though this is an astonishing advancement in technology, there is much to consider before pursuing this movement.",0
"What is the one thing a citizen of the united states sees just about everyday of their lives, vehicles. Vehicles are one of the most important creations America has ever had to offer but sadly there is a catch its killing this planet we call Earth. But there is a simple way to stop this atrocity from going any further. Its quite simple really all we need to do is limit our time driving. The advantages of doing this will help stop air pollution, reduce stress, and help urban and rural areas feel more like a community.

its incredible how with time communitys stopped being what they used to be. What happened to everyone knowing everyone in their community. Well if we limit the time of driving not only will we need to find people to carpool with, Americans are going to start meeting new people and start becoming more of a community again. study last year has shown that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. They either biked everywhere or carpooled with friends and family becoming dependent on other people in their communitys.

The danger and stress that comes with driving is unmeasurable. overtime you drive on the road you are putting your life and everyone your driving with lives in danger. Its only reasonable to say the less amount of people driving the less stressed Americans are. In the passage carfree day spinning into a big hit in bogota, by andrew selsky he states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" and many other articles state that as well such as In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars written by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""when i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way"". Driving less stressed will also lead to less accidents and less deaths per year.

Pitch black sky, every breath you take is killing you, and you wonder why did this happen, and you think back to all the advice people gave to you about driving. The future is sometimes hard to think about when your living in the present but the future will come and what it is will be based on what you make it. Air pollution is one of the biggest risks to this earth we have. To help stop this pollution well have to give up on using gas but for now lets take a baby step and just limit our time driving. Many communitys have stopped and or limited their time driving. Bogota located in colombia, paris, Vauban located in germany, why not just limit time spent driving in America.

Let us be the last of a dying breed and the birth of a new generation by being role models and start acting as americans worried about this planet. Out of everything asked for us to do this is only a tiny portion of it. This change will not only help us altogether it will change the outcome of the future for the better.",0
"The reason why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is because of how interesting it is to examin when you are close to the planet itself. Essentially when thinking of traveling from and beyond, we should not be limited by dangers or even the doubts of such exploration, buy we should expand and exceed to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation that comes from exploring such subtances in space. The true reason for us to examine Venus is for the innovation and progress in science that comes from it and how Venus is the closet planet to have identical features as earth.

Even if our sister planets are out of the question for examination due to dangerous conditions, astronomers are fascinated by Venus since it has the potential to be the most Earth-like planet in our entire solar system. The text states that, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This quote indicates that Venus has similar features to what Earth has; therefore, Venus is the nearest option when looking at planets that are similar to Earth and also the consideration that we have a pretty long time frame for space travel. There aren't many options for a safe and scientifically mission, so this is our best option for porductive wise for us in the space enviroment of exploring. This is one solid reason for the author to say that the trip to Venus would be a worthy pursuit, but would have dangers to it, but we will be able to expand our innovation in the science world.

NASA has a plan to allow scientist to go to Venus with a blimp-like vechile which whould hover 30 feet above the Venusian landscape letting them examine the features of Venus. The quote provides, ""At thirthy-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" The quote indicates that the scientists may feel toasty with that 170 degrees of Fahrenheit on them, but the pressure that is psuhed on the would be the equivalent of the sea level which is on Earth. Overall, these are not the easiest conditions, but it is survivable for humanss to live and stay productive in the task at hand. This is another solid reason for the scientist to travel to Venus and to expand there knowledge and space innovation as well, even with hazardous conditions that are presented during there examination.

By having the will and courage to travel and observe the features of this planet, which has the potential to be similar to the planet that we live on, Earth, we are able to expand our thoughts and innovation of space and able to progress in our space knowledge as a whole. Even though there will be dangers that are presented during the journey, you will be protected by science itself, with its blimps from NASA or the will for observation in comparing Earth and Venus's features. Overall, it is a worthy pursuit to examine and observe the potential to be the identical planet to Earth from its features.",0
"In humans it is hard to detect how someone is feeling, especially when they are doing their best to hide it. What if there was a way to know how your friend or student was feeling emotionally. Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to help detect these emotions and could definitely help in the classroom. Having a computer recognize facial movements could greatly increase the way teachers are teaching their students.

The FACS was created by Dr. Paul Eckman who classified six basic emotions for a computer designed to contruct ""a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" These basic emotions are happiness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and sadness. These are all found by the characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, when raising your eyebrows it sends a signal that you are surprised. When you are angry your lips tighten. This could all very well be detected while in the classroom.

In the classroom teachers normally don't know how a student is feeling. Using FACS could help improve with knowing their emotions. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could help change the students lessons for the better.

FACS is valuable in the classroom to read the emotional expressions of the students. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements - in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This computer can do more than just calculate the basic six emotions, it can even identify mixed emotions. Most kids in the clasroom I'm sure have mixed emotions. It could be about an upcoming test that they are scared to take but are also partially happy to have it over with. With FACS they could know exactly how the student is feeling. According to the article, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This helps show what has changed and what the person is feeling.

The FACS could improve ways for humans and computers to communicate in the classroom. They can detect how the student is feeling on a test, the math homeowork given, or the lesson being taught in class that day. This system can help detect the six basic emotions and mixed emotions. The emotions calculated can act as a human instructor and modify lessons. Knowing that ""most human communication is nonverbal"" would definitely come to use in a classroom of students with different emotions. This is why the FACS is valuable and should be used in a classroom.",0
"Working with a group is more beneficial or working alone is more beneficial? Working with a group is more beneficial. People can get help from another person and they can be more successful by working together. Although some people thinks that working alone is more beneficial, working with a group is more successful because it would be easier to ask for help and to succeed in life.

Some people thinks that working alone is more successful. It gives people time to plan and easier to make good efforts. Some people prefers to not work with a group because they might make bad efforts on other people's work. Overall people says that working by yourself is more beneficial, they are wrong because working with a group can help you be more successful.

Some people prefers to work with a group. It is more helpful to get help from another person. Some people had a hard time planning what they want to work on like homework or school project. Working with a group is more successful because it would be easier to get help from another person.

Some people prefers to work with a group. People can be more successful by working together. Some people had a good idea and they used that idea to make good efforts. Working with a group is more beneficial because they can use other people's idea to make good efforts for their work.

Although some people prefers to work by themselves, a group work will help them be more successful. A group work helps other people to be more successful because one person had an idea and other people can use their idea to get their work completed. People can share their work to another person so they can check if they made good efforts.",0
"There are multiple reasons why seeking other opinions can help someone make a better choice. The first reason why looking for multiple opinions can someone make a better choice is because people have different approaches to different situations. Another reason is because when getting more opinions people can build an overall idea of what is better to do. The last reason is because people think differently so keeping an open mind and listening to other opinions can help people think of their situation differently and make a better choice.

When people get multiple opinions they hear other people's way of thinking and their approach to a situation. People tend to look at things just one way even when trying to have a different point of view themselves. It's hard for people to see things differently on their own. Going to someone else for help can help people see another point of view and help them make a better choice because they have heard another person's way of looking at things. When people look at another person's way of thinking, they may find a better solution, helping them make a better choice.

Having multiple points of view can help a person build up an overall idea of what to do in their situation. They may reflect on all the other opinions they have received and see things differently. When viewing things differently people may find a better solution to problems. This can help someone make better choices since they aren't looking at things from one perspective, instead they're looking at multiple sides of a situation. This will help them think of a different and better choice.

When people keep an open mind and try listening to other people, they have a higher chance of making a better choice. Only taking one perspective into consideration may affect others due to someone not thinking of them at first. Therefore, having a second opinion can help them make a better choice because another person may think of other things or people that may be affected that someone had not thought of at first. A person may also bring up a different point that hadn't been thought of at first which will help a person with their decision making process. When it comes to decision making, taking other things and people into consideration will always help make a better choice.

In conclusion, it is better to find people to go to and get their opinion when trying to make a choice rather than making a choice without a second point of view. It will allow people to have another opinion and make a much better choice because it had more thought put into it. Getting other views will help people make a better choice when things are well thought out. Without another person's perspective, the choice someone makes may not be the best and may affect others negatively.",0
"I agree with this statement, because is hard to be yourself, in a world like this, where the people judge everything in your life, and you have to be how they want, they always are telling you what you have to do or what you not, and they not care about your opinion.

A example:

In my personal life is with my family, they always are telling me what I have to do, and when I do something wrong they judge me, they want to select my friends, my clothes, include my shoes, in a situation like this is difficult to be what you really what to be, and the razon is because they don't give us a chance to demostrate what we really are.

Another example is:

With the people of outside, we never are going to be how they want, if they saw you with a boy who use tattoo they think he is a bad boy, if you are a fat girl your ugly, if you are skinny girl your ugly too, if you use a mini skirt you are a creazy women. So we never will be fine.

Everybody can judge, but we have to be strong, we have to try to demostrate what we are, or what we like to do.

Razons:

We can have a lot of bad situations in this life, Maybe one day we can feel bad or sad, Because we not feel good with the people who judge, maybe we are tired to feign to be another person, or maybe we can think in a negative way. A example of this could be say ""I never do something good"", "" I am not a good person"". So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yurself no one can love you more then you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good.

All this are razons for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razon i agree with Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, cause i feel identified with what he say; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because i don't care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. If I am a creazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine. I like to be happy, be my self. I really love me. I don't have to feign nothing. The little girl who always was doing what the people saying is in the past not in my present. I learning to be my self, so ""Yes"" I make a greatest accomplishment in my life, and is nice to be your self, now i feel relax, and satify with my decisions, I desmostrated what I am. I have a beautiful life, and my life always is with laugh, laugh, I am creazy, and I love to be creazy, my personality is unique. and i like that, so I feel very happy.",0
"students should graduate in three years instead of four years.

It is better for students to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able tho help their families.

The first reason is that students will finish the career that they choose early. students will have 1 years less to graduate. For example, a student is planning to graduate in 2021 and start his career to finish it in 2026 but now that students will be allow to graduate 1 year early then the student will finish his career in 2025. It means that the students will reach their goals early. Students can reach a better life in less time working hard with positive mind.

The second reason is that students will be able to help their families. One year less make the difference. For example, a student's mother is really sick and the student have a part time job ,but he don't gain enough money to buy his mother medicines and he have to graduate but he is still in his third year of high school so he have one more year but now that he can graduate in three years he can receive his diploma and find a full job time to gain enough money to help his mother. It means that one year less can help you change the life of your family to better. One years less can brings chances for others.

Some people believe that students should not graduate in three years instead of four years. However, others including me believe that students should be allow to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able to help their families.

"Imagen this say a presidents term is up and your congress wouldnt you want a say in who you might work with or would you just have to keep up with two candites that you dontknow.

we as a nation should keep the electoral college vote heres why our founding fathers put that in the constitution,this makes congress think harder about this decison.

the founding fathers made that decision the hard way acording to the article the founding fathers put that in as a compramise what this means is they had to do a lot of work to set the system up the way it is its not right to just change the system like that and ruin their work, it has been that way for many years and it has worked alright look at jhon f kennedy we had the electoral colege system in place look how it turned out. Another example george washington look at him first president and his term turned out great so we had a bunch of sucsess with this system its not worth changing with the results it got.

this system makes congress think about its nominations for president for example the article said the electoral college consists of the selection for the electors this means congress hs some time to meet and think in wich to vote. the passage said the electoral college consists of 538 electors so this means they got to reach a consensus and with a concensus everything is put to tghought so the bad things of each candatite is put to tgought.

the passage did say the electoral college is unfair and outdadated but with the results we got from this system however the results have been great this means we had failures but we had some succsess so this system does work and when it does the results have been great. the article did say this winner take all system is unfair to voters but this system has shown great results with various presidints.

the system makes congress think and it has been put in place a long time ago by the founding fathers but it works so congress go look at some future candatites and vote for the best one, citizesens dont let the failures of this system persuade you to not vote go out there and trust the goverment we have gone this lets continue to move fowrward with our countrys economy and vote for the president.",0
"A face on Mars? In 2001 there were pictures take by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft on Mars. Those pictures revealed what many believe was a face. When NASA revealed the picture for all to see they had called it ""a huge rock formation."" They stated, ""it was formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It then became a pop icon.

Some people think the Face is evience of life on Mars. Theorists say NASA was trying to hide the evidece, where defenders of the NASA budget ""wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" So, in 1998 scientists flew over Cydonia taking pictures of what many call the ""Face"" ten times sharper than before. When those pictures were released it was revealed to be a natural landform. But many argued otherwise.

For the third time in 2001, scientists went to take another look. The camera they had used proved to be much more accurate than the one used in the first Viking photo in 76. The pixels of the camera were 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel. According to scientists if there were any objects in the picture such as airplanes or Egyptian pyramids they would be able to be seen.

It is proven that the picture actaully showed butte or mesa landform. These landforms are very common around the West. The landform found was even compared to ""the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a dome about the same size size as the Face on Mars.

It is sad to say that there are proven facts that reveal there is no such thing as the ""Face on Mars"". For years scientists have been studying life on Mars. Even in 1976, 39 years ago!",0
"The 'face on Mars"" is not an alien created thing but an landform. The way that we can back this up because is they took a second photo and it was clear and you can see that it was just a landform. People said that the photo was cloudy so then they went out again in 2001 and the pixels are much better. They went out again and it was not cloudy either. It was clear that the photo was a landform. The last reason is that people from NSA can back up that the face is actually a landform. Gravan said ""that it reminds me of most Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". He also said "" that's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same size of the face on Mars"", so don't believe everything random thing a person says who doesn't even know the facts. The ""Face on Mars isn't a alien or an alien created thing, but a landform that is on Mars.",0
"Phones and Driving

Driving is a good way to get whatever you need to go in a shorter period of time than on foot. Americans like driving from places such as fast food restaurants to appointments or work. As technology advances and people like to accommodate themselves with technology, we also want this same technology with us even in our vehicles. However if someone is driving with a device I think it is dangerous and can cause serious injuries. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it can be a distraction to not only you but others, can cause a car accident, and it can be illegal . If you are not convinced then I'll explain why driving while on your phone is dangerous.

While driving anywhere you need to always focus on who and what is in your nearby surroundings. In fact, according to driving test.org, ¨ texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving under the influence of alcohol¨ . Since the light refracted off the phone is what you are focused on, vehicles or objects approaching would not get your attention. This is especially true when the phone emits a light with a brighter color or image.

Also best case scenario if you do not cause an accident you may even miss your turn or exit all because you were distracted. Worst case scenario you may cause an accident which I will explain next.

Driving while you are on your phone is not only dangerous because it can be distracting but what happens can lead to a car accident. If you do not take the time to focus on the road, your carelessness may harm pedestrians or other drivers. DrivingTest.org says twenty Texting and Driving makes you 23% more likely to be involved in an accident¨ . It then goes on to say that in 2011, 1.3 million automobiles accidents were caused by this and one can only assume that the numbers have gotten higher with technology advancing. A later text mentions that in 2015

¨3,477 people were killed and 391,000 injured¨ in crashes relating to texting while driving. This can even be illegal are result in murder.

Driving while on your phone can be illegal .If my other two arguments have not you proven that on the phone while driving then hopefully this argument will. Driving while holding your phone is illegal in my state of residence of Georgia. It is illegal under ¨the part of a sweeping hands-free law¨ according to www.usatoday.com `Even though driving with your phone may not be illgeal in your state as stated above it can possibly result in murder. ¨Texting while driving can lead to a homicide charge ¨says pittsburgcriminalattorney.com. The site says you get charged with this if you happen to cause the death of a person due to ¨recklessness¨ or ¨gross negligence¨.

Therefore due to your recklessness of not putting away your phone while behind wheels you can face heavy charges when it could have been prevented.

In conclusion driving with a phone present is a sure way to distract someone and possibly an accident. If that is not convincing then the accident can lead to the death of passengers or other drivers. This will result in heavy charges if deemed responsible for death. Therefore save everyone the trouble by simply putting your device away until you reach your destination or parking real quick. Concluding my argument why drivers should not be able to use a cellphone in any capacity is supported by not my words but professionals as well.",0
"The age of cars has come to a grinding stop. Atleast, That's what the general consensus of these 4 articles seems to be. Although current youth do not see car buying as a major thing in their lives right now, it is highly unlikely it will remain as such because of the structure of an average american lifestyle.

Cars are a massive staple of the world and hold many things together and allow for fast, easy, convenient travel. The young people of today do not currently have to use cars to get where they are going because of many factors such as friends with cars, human powered forms of transportation - such as bicycles, skateboards, etc.-and parents with cars. Once these children move away from home to a college or to a job elsewhere they will need a car to maintain a normal lifestyle. We are currently in a second baby-boom, this means that there are many young people that do not need cars and thus do not have one, swaying the data away from the ""car culture"". While it is true that some people are trying to reduce their ""carbon footprint"" by driving less and using public transportation, the number of them is very small and irrelevant when compared to all people in the world. Cars maintain a large amount of appeal that cannot be found in any other form of transportation: This appeal is that it is your vehicle, to do whatever you want with and be free, it is also easy and convenient to get from place to place, it is a place to hang out with your friends and/or a significant other, it is also faster than any other form of transportation short of a helicopter or plane. Cars have so many benefits that people will not just quit driving because of increased carbon emissions, most of which is not entirely the fault of cars.

While cars do put out a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, that amount is inconseqeuntial compar3ed to the massive amou nts of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanos and by other human creations. One volcanic eruption emits around the same amount of carbon dioxide in a few hours as the entire country of America does in 10-15 years. Cars are not the true issue here, the main reason carbon dioxide is on tthe rise is because of the lack of trees and worldwide deforestation. All plant life can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during photosynthesis, this means that more plant life equals less carbon dioxide. Instead of trying to reduce the number of cars in the world and make life harder on many people, the focus of the world should be to increase the amount of vegetation in the world so as to counterbalance the number of cars in the world.

Cars have long been an important factor in the world social, political, and economical structure. Before the second World War, Fuhrer Adolf Hitler decided that his people needed a cheap, basic car so as to increase Germany's economic prowess. Due to this vision Volkswagen, The people's car, was started. Volkswagen marked the start of cheap, affordable cars for everyday people. Although Germany lost World War II, their technology and ideas diffused to much of the world thanks to American and Soviet research. Their idea of a people's car spread around the world and the 1950's marked the start of massive sprawling suburbs that relied on personal vehicles to get to and from work, the store, school, or anywhere outside of the suburbs. This was a totally new type of lifestyle; It wasn't urban life where you could walk or ride a bus wherever you needed, and it wasn't rural where you made everything by hand and didnt travel often. No, this was something entirely new that was brought about because of the advent of cheap affordable personal transportation. Now everyone can get to work relying on only themselves and not bus drivers or train operators, people have a new sense of freedom afforded them by this magnificent new machine, the car.

The same ideas and principles that made cars such an important part of culture and life in the 1950's still remain in our lives today. Cars will remain an important part of world culture until another form of trasportation is easier, more convenient, and/or cheaper. A car gives its driver a fast, freeing, and flexible form of transportation unparalleled by anything today. Car use should not be limited, it should be encouraged.

"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it involves anything to communicate. Professor Thomas Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

The quote says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System).""

Most of the experts can identify how people feel about anything like bored, happy, and etc. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vinci Code!"" Most of the experts knows that faces don't lie. Only the muscles are easy to spot if some people are really ""smiling"" or something else.",0
"i think we should use the facial action because you can go anywhere and see how pepole are today to see if they are mad or angery sad and etc. The facial action coding system should be use in class room so we can see how student are feeling and to see if they are having a good day or a bad day so we can use the facial action coding system to see there facial expersion to every student in class in a way did making a happy face make you slightly happy in the artical it tells us by making a happy face your muscles not only expresses emtions but they will also may even help produce them. Yes we should use the facial action coding system in schools or anywhere in stores,work,airports so we can see how peoples facial expresions are and so we can see if can help them or talk to them so they can have a smile on there faces",0
"Have you ever wondered about space and all of the mysterious things in space? It? a crazy topic with many mystery?. A big idea is that a face has been put on Mars from another life form. It? a rediculous thought with many people such as me shaking their heads at the crazy theroy. There is no way the another life form could put this face on Mars. It? just a cool natural landform that ironicly looks like a face.

Their are many different planets with many different natural landforms on them. Mars just happens to have one of the most interesting natrual landforms however. The face as people call it, is a huge rock formation that gives us an illusion of a face. Humans have claimed that Aliens have put this massive rock formation on there, but from a scientific side their is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that Aliens are real.

Yes, the face is quite mysterious, but their are plenty of queer landforms on every planet. The media is a place that has taken ¨The Face¨ and it has made it out to seem like Aliens have made it to scare us. I can understand why one who has no sceintific background might believe this, but these landforms can occur any where on any planet over a peroid of time.

As a scientist if you belive something you try and prove it. With the discovery of the face and people skeptic of the aliens scientist? launched a spacecraft into space to see if it could find anything. Nothing. No housing systems, no monuments, no building structures of any sorts, and most importantly no life of any sorts. Mars has harsh living conditions so to find any sort of life would be crazy enough, especially aliens!

The face is just another one of those amazing natural landforms that space has given us. It amazes me and others what things can happen in space. There are for sure no Aliens in space, however. All of the evidence proves to the fact that there is nothing on Mars or in space that could build something. Who knows maybe in a million of years space could amaze us even more with another landform similar to ¨The Face¨. I can assure you and the public that ¨The Face¨ was just another marvelous wonder of a natural landform no evidense of anything like aliens. Space is a crazy wonder that has many things to dicover.",0
"Have you ever need to get advice from someone? Getting good advice can be hard, but it helps to get multiple responses. One would want to ask multiple people, this is because people have different opinions than each other. An adult will have a different say on the topic than a teenager or kid. Asking a parent would help because they have most likely experienced what one needs advice on. When getting advice it is best to ask more than one person due to different opinions, different ages affecting their response, and different responses because of experience they may have on the topic.

First, people have many different opinions from each other. An example, if one were to ask there friend for some advice, their friends response would not be the same as their parents response. Another example would be asking a person who grew up rich, tips on saving money, and then asking the same question to one who grew up poor, their responses would be completely different. This is one of the biggest reasons to ask more than one person. Asking multiple people is a good way to get good strong advice compared to just asking one person because everyone has their own opinion.

Next, if one were to ask an adult for some advice they would get good advice, then if they asked a kid they wouldn't get as good quality advice as they would asking an adult. This is a very important reason to ask many people. Asking a kid will give you a different response compared to one who is older. Some kids may think its a joke and say something completely different, but other kids may give you the best response to their ability. Asking kids for advice isn't all bad, it depends on age and maturity. Most of the time asking an adult will usually be better than asking a younger person.

Then, asking someone who is experienced on the topic will be better. This person can tell you the advice they got, and then tell you some of there own advice. Asking your parents is good when your a teenager because they where once teenagers too and probably needed the same type of advice. Someone like a grandparent would be good too because they have been alive for a long time and have had many experiences and could give a person great advice.

Asking a lot of people with experience on your topic will give you the best advice you could possibly get.

Lastly, you can see asking more than one person helps get good helpful advice. People like a grandparent or a parent will give you better more reliable advice, but you still have to ask multiple people to get the best you possibly can. Asking people who are experienced, younger, older, or just different than others, will help you get good advice and the advice you gather will be really helpful. Asking people when you need the advice, even just asking two people will be better than just one, one could ask their parents and get better advice than asking a friend.",0
"Yes, I can see where you are coming from this is because there has been some talk about aliens in the past. Though I can assure you that this is a nautural landform that takes the shape of a face. Sir, I am asking to you please take what I am about to say into consideration. Just listen to me and let me explain to you the scientific proof of how this landoform takes on the label or identity of a face. Yes, I get it with the eyes, nose, mouth, and everything. It is very persuasive to looking like a face. Though it is not an actually face it is a nautural landform that takes the details and characteristics of a face.

I want to draw to your attention that when the face is spotted the shadows of the lanform project onto itself making if look like it has eyes a nose and a mouth. It is just crazy how science works sometimes. But if you just sit and think about it logically it makes sense. But yes, there was a great degree of surprise among our mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. It all came off quite strange. Though when we put it into scientific calulations, the result came back as a nautural landform. And that the eyes, nose, and mouth were just an illusion from the shadows.

Now after hearing all of the scientific calculations, proof, and resonings I hope that you understand where I am coming from. And the fact that it is just a natural landform. Also that it wasn't created by aliens or any other prehistoric creature that claims to live on mars for that matter. Thank you sir for taking the time to listen to my explanations. I highly apprectiate it. Have a wonderful day, and while you are at it I don't mind you sharing my theory with a few other people either. Thank you.",0
"The black smoke that leaks out of your car's tail-pipe is killing you.

With its toxic chemicals, and the stress that goes along with driving ,it's no wounder why our vehicular casutalty rate is so high. The answer seems to be clear,there are many advantages in reducing our car use. Not to mention the money saving opprotunities and traffic reduction that come along with letting go of our belovid crutch.

The world has long bin involved in a ""love affair"" with its cars and other forms of motor transportation, and now in 2015 we are by far, paying the price.

The dangers to your personal health and the health of the enviornment are cringe worthy. France, (being one of the most polluted ares in Europe.) at one point had 147 micrograms of particulate matter in there air. As a result Pairs put a partial driving ban to clear the air and the results where drastic. In just one week the smog cleared up just enough to lift the ban. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up too 50 percent in some areas in the United states. Transportation is the secound largest source of America's emissions. This is cold hard proof that cars are a major contributer to our carbon foot print.

Many other countries have taken the lead in ridding the world of this enviornmental burdon. One of the most major exhamples being a cummunity in Vauban Germany. The inhabitants of this upscale community have simply given up there cars. The residents agree that the lack of cars have greatly reduced there stress. Similarly, in Bogota Colombia, they have created a set car-free day. This has encouraged other means of travel including biking, walking and skating. It's a fantastic way to lower stress and air pollutuon all at once. The word is now spreading through Colombia and 2 more cities have joined and muncipial authorities from other countries are very excited about the event. It sparked a mass improvement leading too new sidewalks, a reduction in traffic, and more upscale buisinesses.

More and more people are startting to catch on. The amiunt of licenses registeres each year are going down drastically and people ""just dont see a need for a vehicle anymore."" A study last year showed the decress in young people driving is at 23 percent between2001 and 2009. People organize there social life or jobs around where they can take public transportation or a bike. The main point in it all is that a car is just another way to get where your going and most dont really care how they get there in the first place.

Vehicle ownership is proving to be impractical, harmful, and expensive. With the rise of pedestrian accsess, bikeing, commercial and public transportation the over use of cars is becoming obselete. We need to improve our safety and lower our emissions to keep the planet and ourselves healthy. ""The proof is in the pudding,"" life without cars is on the rise and it is welcomed with both arms open.",0
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be somehow valuable, it depends who is getting a benefit from it and how the person who is being reading its expressions would feel, but in my personal opinion, I do not find it any value in a classroom.

I can imagine this system in my classroom, I would not behave freely and I think my classmates would be too. When we are in the classroom, we. some us, are there to learn and I admit that sometimes I do not understand not even a bit of the teaching lesson, and this system would benefit us because the teacher will know if we need to be more claryfied when this technology tell him how we feel about the subject, but what if we do not have our mind in the classroom and we would like some privacy, of course we will not have it, and everyone will know our deepest feelings. All of us deserve privacy, and not for only our own good. If we have some doubts and we need help, we would ask the teacher. Some of us do not do it, and might it be for a reason or we just have another source of information, we like to be independent.

If would have to argue where this system would be more valuable, I will not say some where. Everyone is free to express or not express themselves. I think that any reasonable or not reasonable person will agree with me. The use of this technology is valuable depending its purpose, and I find some advantages; when we need help and we do not know how to ask for it, and disvantages; if we are not sure if we really want it, and it is our own job to resolve our problems. There is always pros and cons.

When in school, college; learning, we are still developing skills, and to reach them we have to work for ourselves, we have to be independent and find our pathways. And with this,

I conclude that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not necessary, not valuable.",0
"I have being asked to explain the effects of a program involving pairing, older students , and younger students.

Some schools have a program that pairs older students and younger students. I think that a program like that will be helpful. The older students are available to assist the younger students.

This program can be helpful, to both the older and the younger students, because both the younger and older students, can learn new things from their opponent, or classmate. Also is fair that the older students assist, the younger students, so both of them can be sucessful.

Like maybe the younger students can teach the older students, some new skills the've learned in school, or somewhere else. Or maybe how they've learned to play baseball or softball.

The older students can teach the younger students, how to do algebra / solving equations or how to ride a bike.

Helping out younger students helping order students can be fun and can also turn out to be great. Or sometimes bad.

Like for example, in my school, they have a club that both younger and older students can be in. It is free and not obligatory. So me and some of my friends, joined that club. And also some othe r students. Some of the older students, helped us, if we needed help, and we also helped them if they needed help. Every time during that club we each bring our own snacks or the teacher gives us some snacks himself, and we get to work. That club at school was so helpful for me and my friends, because we can get our homework done in time, and some older students or adults assist us if we need help. Me and my friends also enjoyed that club because it was fun at certain time.

In conclusion, pairing older students , with younger students, can be very helpful to certain people in need.

Being kind an cooperating is the best thing to do while being in a club or working with younger and older students.",0

Opinions

When you need advice do you ask other for there opinions? I know I do all the time. Sometimes getting someone elses opinions helps me make a better choice. Here are reasons why seeking others opinions can help.

My first reasons is when your'e trying to make a choice or a decision you want others opinions. When you give yourself advice and it isn't enough. Going to a parent, teacher or even a friend can help you. People can give others really good advice. They can also see something from a different point of view. Which can sometimes change your mind about something or someone.

My second reason is others probably had to make choices that are similar to yours,so getting there opinion can help a ton. Also, getting one person opinion or getting none at all or just taking your own advice can't help you make a choice. Seeking multiple opinions helps me good choices that can help me now and later on. Also, some people may give you different opinions. Getting different opinions helps you think about your choices.

My last reason is you could also give someone else your honest opinion. They might need your help, because you may give really good advice. Also, if you have gone through the same problem or had to make a tough choice or decision you can give your opinion and help them through there problem.

In conclusion, I thnk getting others opinions or there piont of view can help you make better choices. Not getting any advice doesn't really help make decisions. Asking people who are close to you like your family, getting there opinion makes a difference than not getting any at all.",0
"Dear Senator, I am a student writing to you that we should be changing the Electoral College, to the election by popular vote. If you change the voting system to the election by popular vote, then people are able to vote for who they want to vote, rather than having someone for president as a mistake during the voting. I believe that people should have the right to vote based on the president, not the slate of electors. Also because of the ""disaster factor,"" and because of the ""winnertakeall"" system.

First off, you should change the system to the election by popular vote, because people should be able to vote based on the president and not the slate of electors. It is not fair that the people who pick the electors are people from the states convention, party's central committee or the candidates themselves. The voters should be allowed to control who their electors vote for. Since they are part of the country, they should have a say in the country too. We should not be confused about the voting for the ""wrong"" electors, but be able to know what we are doing.

Secondly, may I recall the ""disaster factor,"" the biggest crisis the century? The Louisiana legislature back in the 1960's, they had some trouble in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors. In fact, they almost did not succeed in doing this. The state's legislatures are probably the ones who are responsible for this incident, because of picking the electors themselves. By keeping the electoral college, you could probably make the same mistakes again.

Lastly, another reason why we should change the voting system to the election by popular vote is, because of the ""winnertakeall"" system. Candidates running for president know they have no chance in winning, if they spend their time in the wrong states. So instead they spend all their time in states are probably going to vote for them.

All in all, we should not be keeping the electoral college, because its unfair to voters who don't know the real reason why they voted for a candidate, people also do not want to make the mistakes they made in the past, and the ""winnertakeall"" system is just irrational.",0
"There are many advantages when you limit your car usage. By limiting your car usage you will have to choose a diffrent way of transportation and thats often walking or riding a bike. Those two choices of transportation are often used as stress relivers. Also you dont have to worry about traffic or having to rush out of work for the gym beacause you have all ready got in a little excrise

For exapmle in source 3 ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" it says "" It's a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". Also when limiting your car usage people often turn to walking, or biking as i've stated before. when a city has a high populltion of walkers and bikers they will have to start making public places closer. As stated in ""source 1"" (¶ 6) "" In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.""When walking you can get a really nice excrise in when getting from place to place and riding a bike can also get your legs in shape. While siting in a car all day dosent help you out at all it's only polluting the air and has you on your butt all day. Less car driving can also mean less car wrecks.

Often people are late to work because of rush hour. As stated in ""source 2"" (¶14)""Congestion was down 60 precent in the capital of france"". while riding a bike you dont really have to think about traffic. Another problem with driving is parking the less cars the less you'll have to worry about a parking space.",0
"So you think that the land formation coincedentally 'a face' created by the weathering. Proves to be a significant amount of source to say there were aliens or a civilation. One thing will not prove anything there are no signs of homes or even indented marks of other species being there only this simple marking. Well i beg to plead the opposing side see what you have seen from 1976,1998, and 2001 is technology has proccesed this and its clearly nothing but a mark. Your conspiracy will live on if this was a life form why would it only be one life form? where are the others there are no trace of them a form of life can not just be created by nothing it has to reproduce. There is only sign of one so there for it does not exist as of the evidence given it is simply just a mesa, a mesa is a rock formation.

this is just a coincedence that it looks of so nasa revealed they wish there was life form to give us more to study of but not much evidence comes from a plain old rock that looks like a face. in conclusion you personally will not change your mind about this becuase it a conspiracy life has been held up by this making money off of this rejoicing of nothing but a rock. Just like area 51 another conspiracy theorys where there is claimed to be unexposed life form when really its just a testing site for us millitary. Also the illumanati claimed to be the ones running the music industry and society. there many conspiracy theorys, but maybe just maybe theyare controlling us of what they dont want us to know making people think the conspiracys are a joke when in reality they are true. Iastly nothing can come off a rock as i said its a natural formation a rock to be 'told'.",0
"Dear State Senator, I am writing to you because I feel that we should abolish the Electoral College. The Electoral College swipes away the meaningness to choosing a president. A nation does not need to rely on a slate of voters to make desicions for us, as an independent induvidual I know that this country should follow the moral laws of which it was founded upon.

With a system like the Electoral College in place, voting becomes pointless. People vote because they feel like part of something bigger, having a slate of electors decide for you takes away the self pride that comes from voting. As mentioned in source number one

What Is the Electoral College?

in the 2000 election the president that won popular vote (Al Gore) lost the election because the Electoral College had the majoraty voting for George W. Bush. The Electoral College takes away the individuals voice.

The College does however provide a reliable service. For instance if there were to be a tie in popular votes, the College's vote would balace it. Still, the downsides of the Electoral College outweigh the benifits. As said in source number two ""We need to abolish the electoral college"".",0
"I am here to discuss with you the topic of the landform on Mars. Yes, it's the one shaped like a human face. I have been getting many claims of it being a monument built by ancient life on Mars. Believe us, here at NASA we would love for the claims of alien life to be true, but we've been given substantial information that those claims are incorrect. There are many reasons why these claims are invalid. First of all, landforms like the so-called face appear on our home planet it would be easy to find; secondly the appearance of a face was given merely by the casting of shadows over the surface over the red plant; and lastly, the intensely zoomed in picture showed no sign of anything that would hint at any type of civilization.

Here on Earth, we have tons of natural landforms created by erosion, glaciers, and the sea. The landform on Mars appears to be a mesa, a landform that happens to be very common in the western area of America. The climate of Mars can be quite similar to that of the West, and that hints to us that because of the hot climate that usually occurs with the sun shining on Mars, this landmark has formed only because of the climate and conditions of the area. It is a reasonable idea to consider and should be proof enough, but there are still some sceptics so I will continue.

Some may say, even if it was a natural landform, how on Earth does it look exactly like a human face? Well first of all, people see what they wish to see. They think it's a face because it is such a fascinating and fantastic thing to think of. ""A human face on Mars?! No way!"" The landform isn't actually shaped like a face, it is merely the shadows that are cast on it that cause the appearance of it being a face. However, upon closer inspection by NASA the landform was revealed merely to be a completely normal patch of land, nothing special at all.

If all of what I'm saying isn't enough to convince you, I have got one more important point to make. NASA has gone to extensive lengths to examine this landform that has caused such a big fuss among the people. In the April of 2008, scientists set out to explore the face of Mars once more. It was an apparently cloudless day and it was that day that they took the picture. The picture was zoomed in as far as it could have been, so that anything on the face of the planet could be seen. There weren't any signs of life, no tents where extra-terrestrial life would sleep and no proof of anything building this landform.

To sum all of this up, there is simply just no way that this landform could have been built by alien life. There are too many facts and too much research done on this landform, we know all there is to know and what we can say for sure is, there is simply no way the Face was createed by Aliens. You'll just have to face the facts and wonder how on earth this picture managed to look exactly like a human face. The mystery was fun while it lasted, but now that we have the facts, it is time to lay this case to rest.",0
"Students believe in praising them builds their self esttem,even when the work is not at its full potential. But others say giveb praise for deficient work undermines the learning by lowering standards

Although student get to proud and tend to over do the work, giving the student praise always comes out to be better than what they actually expected to achieve. Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving.

Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work. Therefore, the work being produced was very productive.

Praising a student builds their self esteem by making them feel good about the work that has been done. Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding.

Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them. Therefore,the student knows that someone is always there to encourage them when needed.

In conclusion,praising students always tend to make them do better. In that case if the students feels good their work will be better.         ",0
"Imagine your country baning driving because of pollution,countrys like Europe and Germany have banned people from driving and if they do it's a fine. In my belief I think its a positive and healthy way to get around town. My reasonings are that it's  healthy way to get around town. It's not polluting the air with harmful chemicals. Even young people driving decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, if this gets to every state in America and people learn more about it, This can become the new culture in every culture. Vauban, Germany's residents gave up their cars and mst of them are soccer moms with jobs, they gave up cars to lower pollution in their country.

To begin most people would find it stupid to give up their cars and ban them because of pollution. Other countrys including some parts of the United States have given up their cars and riding bikes instead, New york has a program called bike-sharing program, studies are suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars and people are driving less and getting their licenses are decreasing as each year goes by, That's leading researchers to believe has America passed driving? Bogota Columbia has banned cars thats still lasting to this day,even in the rain they bike. 70% families do not own cars, and 57% of people sold their car to live in Vaundan, Germany. According to Heidrun Walters, a media trainer and a mother of two said ""when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier""(Heiden Walters, media trainer paragraph 3). Even this mother of two was happy to give up driving.

Furthermore to validate my point on banning cars and riding bikes, every other country is doing it for their sake of pollution, paris banned driving do to its smog, 4,000 drivers were fined. Arent people geting sick of the traffic and the expensive gas to fuel the car, According to David Goldberg, an official Tranportation for America stated that ""All of our development since world war 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change""(David Goldberg, an official Transpotation of America paragraph 7). Theres my other point some point america has to change their ways on cars. I know how much people love their cars, But isn't time to change our ways of transportation, I know riding a bike is less expensive then driving a car, which gas prices are increasing and so is our pollution. You can sit and complain about gas prices and how car insurance is riduliously high or you can give up your car, save money and ride a bike.

America if you car so much about pollution and money then I suggest to you to ride a bike, and dont complain how much money your spending on gas. I'm putting my own thoughts to this essay and proof to you that we should change our ways, maybe even think of your own ideas and save money, while doing the next generation a favor and stop polluting the air with harmful gases that can effect us later in life.",0
"Many people carry out their daily life routine via car. Whether it is to drop their children off at school, or simply taking them to go to any sort of practice. Whichever the case, many find limiting car usage to be the answer to our problems.

One thing most people know is the amount of damage using a car can cause, especially to the enviorment. Air pollution has been a great facor into the problem as well as carbon emmisions. For example, in Europe passenger cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50%

in some car intensive areas across the areas in the United States. Congestion also plays into the problem. In France, there was an increase of smog in their cities, and disel runned cars were to blame. As an outcome, the cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to cage in car emissions.  With the limitation of car usage comes the decrease of toxic air roaming into our atmosphere, and an increase of a healthier lively one.

Besides the enviormental effects car usage has had on us, there is also human effect. Many people around the world have participated in events in which they were to quit the car usage and were to find different methods of transportation, and the feedback was positive. In Vauban, Germany there is a resident of an upscale community whom had owned a car, but had decided to give it up. Heidrun Walkter, a mother of two, had once owned a car but now she walks the streets and is able to hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

The limit of car usage has also brought about more days of physical activity. In Bogota, Columbia, there were millions of Columbians who hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day they had, in attempt to lower the smog in the air. In return, what the people got out of this day was both the decrease in smog, but also the decrease of stress. Not only did the day leave the capital city completely devoid of traffic jams but also brought many people closer with each other. As an example, a man riding a bicylcle with his wife around the city, and says to say it was beneficial for both the enviroment and themselves.

Overall, the limitation of car usage has drastically decreased the amount of air pollution, and smog around the world. It has brought about the sound of children playing and the sound of people riding their bicycles. Many of the countries around the world participate in events to lower the harmful outcomes of the car usage from Germany to Paris, to Columbia and the United States, but there are still efforts in which they are present.",0
"My mom receives two emails, one for hockey, and one for football. Now I have to choose hockey or football, both are expensive, so I can only play one. The next day I walk up to my friends for advice, before school starts, on what sport I should play. I like to ask what others would do so I can get their opinions on what I should pick or do. It is good to talk to more than one person for advice because you can hear from other's personal experience, hear what others would do, and they can help list the Pro's and Con's about your choices.

When I have to make a choice it helps to hear from personal experience from others. One reason is you can hear why they did that choice. I like to hear what motivated them to make that choice, and if it was a good motivation. My brother played football because he though it looked fun and he wanted to try something new. Another reason it helps to hear from personal experience, is if they liked what they choose. It is always helpful to hear the outcome of after the choice was made, and if they were grateful or regretted the choice they made. My brother was grateful for playing football because he made more friends and learned a new sport. A final reason why it is helpful to hear from personal experience is, so you can find out if they would or wouldn't recommend it for you. Before making that finale choice, it is always helpful to see if they would recommend it. If they recommend it great, that means that they think you would be happy with that choice. If they don't recommend it that is okay, but I would not make that your final choice because they think it won't be the best option for you. My brother would recommend football for me because he knows that I like to try new things and I like to run. It's always great to hear personal experience from someone if it was good or bad. It is always appreciated to hear what others would do, even if they don't have personal experience.

When asking others for advice it is great to see what they would chose ,if they had to choose between those options that you have to choose from. It's helpful to hear their reason behind the option they would choose. When I asked my friend ""Would you rather play hockey or football"", she said "" Hockey because she loves to skate and it just seems like a fun sport to play"". When I asked another friend the same question all she said was"" I would play football,"" She didn't even give a reason why.

What is the point of choosing an option if you don't have a reason to back you up. That just shows you're picking an option for the sake of picking an option. When people share their opinions they influence your final choice. When you add all the opinions people gave you it can help you make the right choice, therefor influencing your final choice. It's always great to hear what others would do, and why they would make that choice.

I also find it helpful to make a Pro's and Con's list, It's even more helpful when you make it with someone. It always helps when listing things about what is good about the choice. That list gives you a sense about why you should pick it and why it is better than the other choice. One good thing about hockey is that you get to learn how to handle a hockey stick. When making a Pro's and Con's list, you have to include the bad parts about your choice. One bad part about hockey is that you have to be good at ice skating. Once you list the bad parts about both sides it gives you an idea on why you shouldn't pick that choice. When you make this list with a friend or family member, they can help with coming up with things to add to the list. Even though this list isn't giving you a straight opinion, it is still helpful. Once you look at both the Pro's and Con's together it can help you get an idea on what you are going to choose. Making a Pro's and Con's list can be really helpful, it can be even more helpful when you do it with someone.

It is good to ask more than one person for advice because you get to hear their opinion on what they would do, they can help list the good and the bad on each choice, and you can hear what they choose when they had to choose between those options. Asking for advice is really helpful than just picking a random choice with out any advice. When you ask for advice from someone you can never go wrong.",0
"When people ask for advice, they mostly don't talk to one person they talk to more then one. This can help you and other people to make a better choice. They can give you more opinions. You would have more people to talk. They all have different ideas.

One reason that can help you and other people to make a better choice is talking with more people other then one. When you are talking to more then one person they have more opinions then one person. Making a cirlce and talking about what you think is going to help you make a better choice could help more then one person. If you think that one opinion is not going you make you do a better choice you have another choice to make.

Talking to more people for an advice. They could have different ideas that you can help you with the right choice that you want to make. You can hear different people taliking and not only one. If you and other people think that the choice that you are going to make is not a good choice you have more then one person to talk to. You would have more people that will help you with your adice.

This are my reasons why this can help more people make a better choice. They are many more reasons that can help people to make a better choice. If you are talking to one person they are going to help you but if you are talking with more then one person. You have a better chance to make a good choice.",0
"Dear Senator of Florida, I think changing the election by popular vote for the President of the United States would be a better and and more fair way of voting. The Electoral College may work and all but even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the President."" Voting gives people rights and freedom that not everybody has. If a voter wanted to vote for a President their vote should go towards the President, not the electors of the state, in all fairness. According to Plumer many people agree with the idea of changing the voting system by stating, ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" In plumber's article he says, the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" By putting this statement in his article he is trying to say that the system we have now could all go up in flames if the right thing happened to get rid of the Electoral College, so Americans should watch out. The Electoral College is unfair due to the winnertakeall system. In this system candidates for the presidency don't go to smaller states because they know they won't win with those states. They stick to the big states with more electoral votes or with the ""swing"" states. That's what I call selfish.

I understand that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" If the next President were to win the electoral vote but not the popular vote that is like saying that only the Electoral College voted and not the real voters, the people.

All in all ""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" I would greatly appreciate if you read this over and thought about the topic I have addressed to you. Thank you for your consideration.",0
"For technology to be able to read the emotional expressions of students would be very beneficial . Some students could struggle with verbally expressing their emotion's making it hard for their teacher/learning coach to know the most successful way to teach them. Therefore if the student starts to get bored, anxious, or confused the computer could pick up on those emotions and make changes to the student's learning lesson to help get them back to focus and engage with their learning . ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ""Dr. Huang predicts. ''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. ''

Mental illness is on a rise amongst people in general, Students suffer from it too they're not indestructable or working machinces.

Technology being able to read emotional expressions of students is very valuable it could help students to feel less stressed when working on a lesson they struggle with , without the panicky feeling of having to talk to the teacher about it infront of the class which could cause anxiety . With a majority of communication being nonverbal it can be hard to understand even for humans , technology being able to pick up on it would be alot easier and not feel as intrusive as the student having to explain themselve to the teacher/learning coach. ''Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,'' notes Dr. Huang. ''So computers need to understand that, too''.",0
"I believe that we should be able to have the popular vote, so we can be able to choose who we want as our leader and for the reasons that we want them to lead our country. When we vote we accpect that whoever got the popular vote should be our president we dont want the Electoral College to change and over power our voting. We want our right to vote to actually mean something and for us to make some decisions in our country and who should be the leader.

When we where given the right to vote and given some power to our popular vote we we were accpecting to be able to use that right to help descide what is best for our country. as it says in the article,

""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president..."". What that means to me is that when we vote for our president we are just helping our electors have a better point in our sperspective. So when we vote we aren't really getting what we want we are just helping the electoral college get what they want. We should be the ones who are getting what we want we are the ones out there struggling and fighting for what we want. The Electoral College doesn't care about what we want and how we feel about the situation. If we were givven the right to be ablle to vote we accpect for that to happen so there really isn't any point in voting because we still have a chance in having our popular vote getting over ruled. That isn't fare to us to be given a right and it not being any power in our favor. This is the same reason why everyone doesn't vote is because they feel that there vote won't matter do to the Electoral College.

More importantly we have our right of freedom of speech from the Bill Of Rights. Also the Electoral College has 538 electors and they only need a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect our president. So that means the they get the popular vote as well as we do but the only difference is that they have more power than we do which isn't part of our rights. So that being said they dont care what we say either way its going to end up in a popular vote the will just have the final vote and that means they get what they want. Also as the article states in the second section that,

"" according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of votors would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."". That right there is saying that he won the votors popular vote bout because of the Electoral College he lost the presidency. So he won the part of the election but due to the people with more power he lost which is wrong and shouldnt be allowed. As I was saying the people that actually get effected by the election and the president should have the upper hand in power. Another quote from section three,

""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled..."". There is another reason that the the Electoral College should be excluded from the election of the president.

In conclusion as the citizens of the United States of America should have the say in who is our leader and how the election is decided. The Electoral College should be overruled by the citizens and have there power taken away from them. We the people that want the right president for our country should have the power. As our right to vote should be enforced and respected. Also we all should come together as a country and fight for what we believe is right and for what we deserve as a nation.",0
"""Failure is not the worst thing, not to try is worst thing in the world."" To become successful, people must try. They should not give up. If people fail and grow up without losing hope, they can be successful in their future. Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life.

Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she don't like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.

Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didn't pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesn't mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life.

Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And people have to have positive energy and hope to handle any situation. Because failure is an important role that plays in the pursuit of success.",0
"The car is a staple in modern day society by many standards, it represents wealth, societal rank however on the more negative side of the matter cars are the result of a majority of deaths in the United States. Alongside the fatalities, cars also pollute the environment that is so very delicate. The benefits of becoming carfree are immense and far outweigh the ""negatives"" that come alongside living without cars.

Cars as many people know see them are recognized for their glamour and attraction, but what is forgotten somewhere in the infatuation with cars is the true devastation they can cause. Cars in the United States and many other countries around the world account for a majority of the fatalities in total. Living without cars would completely irradiate the fatalities due to cars as well as reducing the stress that comes along with having such a hefty responsibility.

Along with the potential danger to humans, in the United States cars are the second largest source of emissions right behind power plants according to paragraph 34. Countries like India and China are among the top few most polluted cities on this planet now imagine the impact of implementing a carfree law. The amount of pollution would go down immensely and the effect that this would have on the lifespan of people living in those countries would be incredulous. Some will argue that this will negatively have a change on their life. And to that I would say, are you willing to sacrifice some of the comfort that a car supplies you for a better life for your children and grandchildren?

Many people acknowledge that buying a car is arguably the second largest and expensive purchases that will be made in your life second to a house. The amount of money that would be saved from living a carfree life would be incredible. Without having to pay car payments, car insurance, and gas fees every month imagine what this money could be going towards. Removing such a monetary factor would reap such high rewards that so many would agree is completely worth some of the sacrifices that would have to be made.

All in all cars are not completely necessary, and that implementing such a thing would have such a benificial outcome for society as a whole. Think not about the present but about the future of the world, and by living a carfree life you are bettering the present community as well as the future world.",0
"In this writing prompt the topic that is going to be disscused is that if the Idea of technology going to be able to predict what humans are feeling an a emotional level.

The Idea of a facial expression reading computer is a good idea but for as long it is used for the right intentions such as using it to read picture of families to know how they are feeling, or using it for a class that is not interested into a subject so the computer alters the lesson to change up the lesson to make more entertaining for the students, but for advertisements that is not very good way to use technology in that way. If the human race is going to use technology like it should be used responsibily and used to help man kind to strive to become better.

The technology for this is remarkable and how we are going this far to use technolgy like this for only medical purposes, for learning, and to see if some one is lying or telling the truth. If it is going to be used to fill companies pockets full of cash for advertisements it shouldn't be allowed cause taking photos or using technology to invade on peoples privacy just to adjust their own benefits, and I can see it being used for purposes like art work just like the Mona Lisa .

The Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and really what makes it remarkable it tells you all of the emotions that they are feeling rather than just one specific emotion. It tells you from the emotion they feel the most to the one they feel the least about.

It is outstanding how technology could come so far in a short amount of time and their is a saying that comes with it comes great power, comes great responsibility and their is technology that is either taken for granted or it is misused for the all of the wrong reasons. The FACS or the facial action coding system it could be very useful in for medical research or it can help detectives to tell them what are witnesses or patients feeling so that they could help them get through their isssues in life.",0
"Teacher want to make a homework clube for student at schools. I think they want to start this club so students do there homework for offten and teacher are going to helps you if your need help. This is going help kids be responsible and learn more. Doing a homework club after school is going to help kids alot.

2.

I think its a good idea but also a bad idea. The reson why i think its good is because it can help kids if they need help. The reson i think is a bad idea is beacause kids are going to have to stay after school but its bad cause they might have somthing planed. Its good and bad cause kids need to learn how to be responsble.

3.

Tenns/kids might think its a waist of time. They might get bored and just might not to there homework. They wont like staying after scchol kids and teens might just think its a waist of time. They just mont like it at all.

4. i support this because its going to help students out by doing there homework. Students are going to do there homework now. Even tho they might thinks its dumb its not its relly going to help them. Hopefully student start doing there homework now.",0
"For many years now people have been cutting down on the usage of their cars. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like you become happier, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. many different outcomes come from limiting the amount of time you use your car.

In many countries around the world people have reduced the amount of time they use their cars and the outcome has been phenomenal. Heidrun Walter was asked about how she felt about taking cars out of her life, she answered ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Rosenthal par3. Cars have been liked stress and when cars were taken out of Carlos Arturo plazas life he said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Selsky par24. When cars were taken out of their lifes they felt happier and stress free.

In these last few centuries we have polluted the world more than anyone else has. This is due our technological advances. One of the biggest advance in these centuries is the motor vehicle. The car has now become a household item. Cars are one of the main reasons why our ozone layer is open and we responsible for ""50 percent...of greenhouse gases emissions"" Roseenthal par5. It's shocking to see how far we have advanced but to see how much we have destroyed in the world at the same time is crazy. Paris has become so poluted that they had to get a ""partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer par10. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after fivedays intensifying smog"" Duffer par14. Imagine what would happen if cars were reduced in use for a month.

For many people in these countries they have gotten many benefits back. The government has always used ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" Rosenthal par9. Its shocking how much money goes to bulding roads and not things for the development of our communities. The people in Bogota,Colombia have cut back on their use of their cars anf the money the government usually uses for cars or gas is now going to other things. ""Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city.""Selsky par28. many of the ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Selsky par28. When the goverment did not have to pay for highways or streets they used that money for parks or smooth sidewalks.

Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like people become happierand stress free, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. If everyone cuts back on the time they use their cars the world would be healthier, the population would be heathier and happier, in addition the government would use money for more important things. Reducing the use of cars is step one in the world becoming healthy again.",0
"What is the point of having to ask people for opinions?

What happens when you ask people fro responses and also does it help you making a huge decision?

How you need to help others make a decision?

Having to make a huge decision is a pretty hard thing to do, because it may be the decision you are taking for your family , your friends or even for your self. It can be any decision because after you make the decision you might not be able to change your decision . You may have made a good or a bad decision and after sometime when you have made the decision you should not be regretting about the decision you made,instead you should be proud of the decision that you have made thinking that you have done the right decision. And this is a reason why you need to ask opinions from people and also tell people about your opinion when someone asks you something. One more thing that you need to remember is that you should always talk to people before you make the final decision.

For example let's say you are buying a house for your parents and it is pretty hard to chose a house because you liked all of the houses you have seen so far. Now the only thing you are thinking about is which house I should be buying , so now the first thing you should do is go to your parents and show them some pictures of the houses you have seen and ask which one they liked the most. Then you need to go to other people and ask their opinions but never forget to consider every one's opinion because it is a way you show respect to each other no matter what their opinion was , lets say even if you think their opinion was the most horrible opinion anyone has told you. The only way to be nice to people is by showing respect to them. So now lets get back to the topic , now you have asked everyone their opinion and then you sit down and think about the decision that you are going to make , finally you come to a decision and then you go and tell everyone your decision and then buy the house for your parents. This is how you make a huge and a very stressful decision.

Now lets say you have a best friend who needs to make a huge decision like moving to another country without their family and that is a pretty hard thing to do . Its really hard to live without your family for years and years together, there is never so much fun without having your family with you no matter what, even if you live with your best friend. So now your friend has got a job in Generic_City and their family lives in the U.S.A

,he doesn't know if he should move with his family or just go by himself , he can't either leave the job offer because it is a pretty big company so he comes and asks you for an opinion and you say that ""I think you should take your family along with you if they are interested to go to Generic_City with you"" .Then he goes to other people to ask their opinions after he has asked everyone their opinion he comes to make the final decision , soon after he tells everyone his decision and does the right thing for him and his family.

Do you guys see how people make huge decisions and the reason they are able to make such good decisions is because of taking peoples opinion. When you take many opinions you can combine it into one whole decision and that's the whole point of making a good decision and the decision that you made can be the best opinions of all the opinions you had asked. After you make a really good decision , you will be really proud of it and I don't think it will be so much harder when you have to make other big decisions too. But still if you can't make a decision you can always ask people for their opinion. They will also be happy to share their opinion's. And they also might help you a lot to come to a final decision.

Have you ever had to make a decision for your self or your family?. Well if I had to answer this question it would be a yes because, I moved here from Generic_City and it was a pretty hard decision to make because my sister got a college and it was her dream come true.

Even though I was born in Generic_City

I didn't want to come here because I lived in Generic_City for literally 10 years and I had so many friends but at the same time I wanted my sister's dream to come true and she was also born in Generic_City and had stayed in Generic_City for 10 years too. But she still wanted to come for college here. So I didn't want to break apart her dreams and then I asked many people for an opinion and finally I came to a decision and now I am happily in America and so is my sister . And that was my final decision and I really proud of it because even I am having and my sister I having the fun most , she has so many friends and I guess she has never had as much as fun she is having right now and I am really happy for her but at the same time I miss her the same because I lived with her for long.

Every decision you make always has an happy ending because you alwyas will make a good desicion and and after sometimes you will be so proud of the decision you made anad you will never forget the desicion that you made but sometimes you may not have made a good decision so always remeber to take an opinion so that you will not have to regret it after the decision is been made. And sometimes you may not want share your problem with anyone and you still have to make a decision, then you should ask someone who you trust.",0
"Phones and Driving

Phones have become an essential of human lives, 68% of Americans own smartphones. Some people use it for entertainment and others use it for education and work, but it can also be distracting because people can not put it away even while driving. Nearly 40,000 each year are injured or killed due to a phone caused car crash in the United States. Even though phones can be devastating, they can be used to contact emergency authorities during a crisis on the road, on the other hand they can be hazardous when used for any other reason like calling, texting, or anything else related to looking away from the road.

There is a four second interval between a phone related car crash, a phone rings the driver takes their eyes for at least two seconds to find it, then they answer it before looking back on the road, at this point it can be too late to prevent a fatal crash. The drivers sense of sight, hearing and hand coordination are temporarily lost. Driving is a serious and dangerous task, all attention should be focused on the road, so the individual can drive safely for themselves and other roadway users.

Using your phone while driving is basically like closing your eyes and taking your hands off the wheel. The driver can potentially harm roadway users around them like pedestrians, bikers, truck drivers, and motorcycles. According to the Association for Safe International

Travel, ""Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44.

Each year nearly 400,000 people under 25 die on the world's roads, on average over 1,000 a day."" Many of the crashes could have been prevented if drivers had full attention on the road.

Some of the newer cars are fitted with the handsfree mode where the driver connects their phone through bluetooth. This helps drivers decrease hazards if it is used properly, and there are now cars with autopilot. It helps to put your phone on do not disturb mode or putting it somewhere requiring you to stop and safely use it. Many states are now passing a strict no phone policy in cars, like Georgia if a police see a driver with a phone in their hand they can now be fined.

People have to become more responsible while in the cars, they should always remember to wear seatbelts, use their phone only when there of the road and parked somewhere safe. If used correctly phone can be useful for emergency situation on the road, but they can also be a danger for the individual and other people around them if they are used incorrectly.

"If people limited the use of cars the earth would be able to have enough time to clean its atmosphere, but the only downside to this is that in cities buildings are farther away then they are like in passage 1 where as everything is in walking distance, but in cities that are meant for walking to different locations would cause a major problem with older adults. I do see this happening in small towns but cities would be more difficult to travel to unless they rebuilt everything within walking distance.

Now if America's citizens are driving less each year then let it happen and in a few years come back to the data that is presented in passage 4. So basically let it all happen on its own and not have to force it like Paris has done with giving out fines for whoever is driving a car with odd numbered license plates on mondays and even on tuesdays.

"Do you think the face on Mars is a natural landform? According to many scientists and conspiracy theorists, the face on Mars is a natural landform. Nasa spoke out about the face on Mars. Also, Michael Marlin and Garvin shared their opinions on the face. The face on Mars is a natural landform because of what the picture revealed,showed, and had captioned.

The face on Mars had a caption from Nasa. After the discovery of the picture, Nasa unveiled the image for all people to see. The picture had a caption noting a huge rock formation. The formation resembles a human face. It has a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a noes, and mouth.

The face on Mars had revealed somthing. Michel Malin and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a sharp picture. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. The website revealed a natural land form (meaning there was no alien momument).

The face on Mars showed somthing to Garvin. The picture actually shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. It reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain is a lava dome. It takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

The face on Mars resembles a natural landform. There is alot of evidence to support this claim. Such as Michel Marlin's,Nasa's, and Garvin's evidence. The face on Mars is a natural landform because of what the picture revealed,showed, and had captioned. Do you believe the face is a natural landform?",0
"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age.

Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since they're still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldn't have to worry about what career they want since they're still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life.

In conclusion, i think students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.",0
"Whoever thought that a machine could read a person's emotions? To our surpise, a highly advanced technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is capable of reading one's emotion by calculating the movement of our face muscles. Some may say that this technology has no value and should be abandoned. However, it is clear that this technology has a great amount of value because it helps us better understand the muscles in our face, it improves communication between people, and can improve the quality of faces in computers.

First of all, the experts of the software are constantly experimenting on different parts of the muscles in our face. By doing so, the experts are better understanding the part's of the muscles. On paragraph 3, the author cleary states that, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This shows that the experts have noticed these odd movements of the muscles. The muscles function similarly to legs. Also, on paragraph 4, the author talks about how this new technology can even detect ones mixed emotions. The evidence that he uses is the painting of Mona Lisa. The painting was filled with different types of emotions such as 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Next, the technology has played a major role in improving our communication between people. On paragraph 6, the author shows us that most communications between people is through nonverbal. The technology can help ones understanding of emotional communications, thus improving their nonverbal communication. The technology can tell when someone is zoned out or just completely bored. On paragraph 6, the author states that ""A classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This machine could better the communication between teachers and students.

Not only does this machine improve communications, this machine can improve facial expressions in our games and our technology. At the middle of paragraph 6, the author states that ""The same technology can make computer-anmated faces more expressive"". This will improve the quality of our video-games. Video games will become more vivd and realistic. Also, in the medical field, this improves the video surgery. With a better video surgey, more lives will be saved.

Lastly, the facial technology will and has played a major role in our lives. This machinery is a huge technological discovery and should be continued. This is because the technology has helped us better understand our facial muscles, has improved nonverbal communications between people, and has improved the quality of our computer-animated faces. This technology can play roles in almost every thing we do. From video games to hospitals, this machine does it all.",0
"Would you ever want to live on another planet if humans and other life could live on it ?The author well supports his idea about ""The Challange of Exploring Venus"".

There would be a little chance of any human or life to live on venus. On venus the planet reamins unliveable to human. In the many times they sent spacecrafts to venus, venus had claimed the lives of the people inside the spacecraft. Since then NASA would not send another space shuttle to venus and it has been like that for 3 decades now.

The planet venus also known as the ""Evening star"" is one of the brightes in the night sky. Venus is also like a twin of earth the characteristics of this planet is alike except for the speed and the size.

A thick atmosphere of about 97% of carbon dioxide covers the planet venus. When you pass that the surface of the earth is 800 degrees fahrenheit and verry deadly to any creacher that lives on earth. the atmospheric pressure is 90% than what we experience here. So why do scientist still study and figure out how life can form on this planet? well...Scientist want to study this planet because they believe it was similar and an earth-like planet. When the planet was and Earth-like planet it could have supported the life that lives on the actual earth now. On venus there were oceans,rivers,valleys,and ect. could we return to this planet? Scientist say that returning to earth is indisputable. Scients also want to figure out how they can send people there and be successfull? NASA want to design a blimp like vhical that can hover over venus without touching the unbarable ground but would give little insight of the planet. Scientist could not take samples of rock or gas or anything eles. Many researchers are tryin to come up with an idea so that they can get all their information on venus.

All in all, the author supports the idea of the life on venus and the past with great details that backs it up. Also that the author wants the readers to know that giving up on something will not help you succeed but to keep working on what you are trying to achive to get something great out of it and to figure out how to bypass the obsticals.",0

Losing your life over having a cellphone in your hand or trying to respond to a text that can wait is not worth your life. It is not that serious to ruin someone else's life and yours to send a text back to your homeboy saying your on the way. Stop signs maybe but while driving of course not.

Using your cell phone on the road is nothing to play with. Driving without a phone in your hand is hard enough. You have to focus on your surroundings and other people driving is hard enough. I think I can speak for everyone when I say stuff can happen right before your eyes. That means as soon as you look down to send a text back to your girlfriend you can be in a ditch or through a building as soon as you look up. I feel like there should be more technology that can help people use their devices on the go. But the way it is looking now in the world it does not need to be addressed at this moment.

Moving on, I feel like people should not be able to have their phones active while driving. And music should not be played loud enough to where they can't hear the outside world. Personally I don't like how people do that. It is dangerous to others and themselves. But more phone laws should be introduced because that is way too many deaths to be comfortable with. I don't want to be known at my funeral for being killed all because I was texting a friend.

InConclusion, phone laws are looked over in the country today. If we want to cut down on these deaths we need to take action on the little issues that are called cell phones.",0
"I think that a Facial Action Coding System would be helpful in a classroom setting. I think this because it could show the teacher what students needed help by the ones looking confused or frusturated. This definitly could be a helpful tool when it is more available.

To go more in depth of how this could be beneficial to a classroom would be it helping confused students who are maybe more shy than others and dont ask the teacher for help when they need it. This program could be in their computer and then it could tell the teacher who looked confused about the work and they could go over and help them easier. Also like it says in the article ""Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor."" Which is another great idea!

This may not even just help the students, but it could help the teachers become better teachers. This could be done because lets say the students go home and 90% of them look confused or frusturated well the teacher could see that and could either explain it again the next day or make the assignment easier to do. Which from my experience of being a student that would be super nice to have.

Finally if the teacher was really dedicated to their job they could see if students were bored in their class, if so they could try to make it more fun. This could make students pay more attention in class and could increase the graduation rate and even the grade point average of students since they will be having more fun in class and would be more likley to participate.

In conclusion yes I do think we should get this when it becomes more available to public. I think that there is just so many more positives to having these Facial Action Coding Systems than negatives. It could really be a beneficial thing for schools to have in the classroom.",0
"Explorering venus comes with a high pay off but high risk. The authors claim is correct becuase it has enough information ot back up the idea. Venus's geographical and atmospheric condtions would not be ideal but it would provide anthor option for colonization in the future. The exploration of Venus is worth while scientific endver.

The Authors study on Venus provides enought facts and evidnece to condiser further evaluation of the planet. ""Long ago, venus was probaly coverd in large oceans and could have supported varouis forms of life, just like earth today"". The planet has a surface temperature of 800 degrees farien height. Also the planet has a much higher atmospheric pressure at over 90 times greater than Earth.

Venus is closer to our plant than we thought. Even thought its atmosphere contains clouds that are made out of higly corrosive acid. ""The surface has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters"". The terrian is showen to be ruff but not unbarable for human colonization. Also Venus is one the closest planets to own own planetthan most others. The due to the ground condtions being hostile surveyers would need to be located 30 or more miles above the surface of the planet.

Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet.",0
"Around the world, cars are the main use of transportation. The exhaust from cars causes pollution in the air worldwide. By limiting car use, you can easily cut the pollution levels released by cars in half. There are many great aspects of limiting car use. Some international cities have already set a day where citizens do not use their cars. Limiting car use is a great option for the environment. As it can help many individuals from all around the world.

In the city of Vauban, Germany, most citizens do not even own vehicles. ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""Rosenthal, 3 Vauban claims to be a car free community. The banning of cars is a ""growing trend in Europe"" Rosenthal, 4 The movement is called ""smart planning."" Rosenthal, 4 Cars play a huge roll in polluting the Earth. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Rosenthal, 5 The ""environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities."" Rosenthal, 9 Limiting car use is a huge benefit for the Earth and people living in it.

In Paris, France, the pollution levels are increasing drastically. For that reason, Paris has decide to ban driving for two days. Citizens who failed to not drive were punished with a 31 fine. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Duffer, 14 This statistic shows that by the limiting of car use, traffic levels may change drastically. From the lower use of cars on the roads, the smog above Paris was clearing and moving towards Beijing. Which is ""one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Duffer, 14 The main cause of the pollution is diesel fuel. France in particular favors diesel fuel. ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France"". Duffer, 16 This is the primary cause of the pollution in the city. By banning the cars, the city recieved clarity from the smog surrounding it prior to the ban.

In Bogota, Colombia, one day a year they ban all cars despite public transit. They have been doing this for three years. If a citizen failed to obey the car ban, a 25 dollar fine was given to them. Buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""Selsky, 24 The car ban is part of an improvement campaign from the mid1900s. Rain or shine the residents of Bogota still participated. This past year two additional cities participated in the movement. The movement has shown great success and has been helping with pollution and stress many individuals face daily.

In the United States of America, President Obama wants to lower the rate of greenhouse gas emmissions. Studies show that ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""Rosenthal, 29 In 2005, there was a peak of the miles driven. In 1995, this was 9 percent lower this was also the case in April of 2013. Michael Silvak, an individual that studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute said, ""rates of car ownership per house hold and per person sdtarted to come down two to three years before the turn down."" Rosenthal, 33 As the years have past, the numbers of car owners have decreased. Although the idea of limiting car use sounds like a great idea, it will eventually hurt the automotive industry. People will stop purchasing cars due to these bans.

There are many widespread advantages to limiting the car use of individuals around the globe. Greenhouse gas emmission levels are essentially rising. By taking action and limiting car use, the world can decrease these levels. Less use of vehicles can help relieve stress, a condition a lot of people face around the globe. It is truly amazing that by banning cars for a day, the surrounding smog was clearer in Paris. The widespread happines in Vauban, Germany due to carfree living is another great outcome. Bogota's influence on two other cities is also very empowering. Limiting car use is not as bad as it may seem. In the long run, it will benefit our surrounding environment.",0
"Dear Senator Nelson, In recent years, many people have called for the change of the presidential election process. Specifically, the Electoral College. Many consider it a pointless, unfair, and archaic system that denies the people the liberty of choosing their president. However, I believe the Electoral College is a necessity in modern America. Although it is as old as the country itself, it is still relevant and useful today.

The Electoral College ensures the outcome of an election. Without the Electoral College, the election may possibly need multiple reruns as a result of a tie in the popular vote. According to ""Does the Electoral College work?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"". With that few of electors, it reduces the chances of a tie occurring. Although it can happen however, it's not probable. For example, if two candidates ever had a tie among the popular vote, it could be resolved within the college because of the way the slates of electors are divided up among the states. Some critics of the college say that this systems takes the control out of the peoples hands and denies them the right of choice. However, you have to remember that the people elect a slate of electors to vote for their candidate. That means that even though the College ultimately decides the president, the people still have someone to represent their candidates.

The Electoral College is also a necessity because it forces the candidates to face issues the people care about and to appeal to the masses. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluralarity in those states"". This means that in order to win the popular vote and get a chance to win within the Electoral College, a candidate must appeal to the country, not just a particular set of voters who may have different views on politics than the majority of voters. Some people say that a candidate may try to appeal to a set of voters but in the end just use them in order to win the presidency. To that I say this. As a candidate, your ultimate goal is to serve two full terms as the president of the world's leading superpower right? Why would a candidate want to lie and jeprodize their chances at doing what they feel is right for the country?

In Conclusion, the Electoral college must not be done away with. It is a necessary tool to maintain fairness among the candidates and the election process. We have checks and balances among the government so one branch of government may never gain more power over the others so why not supervise the most important process in government? If you take anything at all away from this letter, please let it be this. The Electoral College is a staple in American politics. Without it, we would be denying our country the right to a fair election.",0
"Throughout the years, humans have always had to get from point A to point B. To make this easier they use cars. But with air pollution and traffic being an issue in most countries, mayors are deciding to put down the car keys and pick up their walking shoes.

To begin with, air pollution is becoming a big issue on the Earth. Greenhouse gases are being released and most of them come from cars alone. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Section 1, Paragraph 5). Cars and trucks are causing our Earth, our home, to waste away because of the gases they give out. If more people decided to walk to where they need to go instead of driving, then it would reduce the gases that cars and trucks give out. With more people walking rather than driving, it would make the air more clean and the Earth a better place to live.

Further more, another reason people should decide to put down their car keys is because of the traffic that cars cause. Why France was trying to get rid of smog, they banned people from using their cars. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"" (Section 2, Paragraph 14). If more people walked or used public transportation rather than their own cars, traffic jams would decrese and also crashes. When people drive their own cars they tend to lose focus and they might hit someone. With less people driving then there would be less deaths from car accidents. Putting down your keys and walking or using public transportation, would be beneficial to not only you but also everyone else too.

In conclusion, people rely on cars every day of their lives. To get you to where you need to go, but if we continue to use cars every day and destroy the Earth then there will be no where for us to go in the future. Polluting the air and causing car accidents and deaths is not what we need to be doing. Put the keys down, and walk!",0
"In life there are many hard choices to make. Seeking more than one person's advice can help you make the right decision, but if you make the wrong choice it could be a learning experience. Some choices are harder than others therefore, asking other people for their opinions can lead you into make the best choice. When it's time for you to go to college making the right decision to which one to go to can be a very hard, by seeking other people advice can help make you choose the right decision. This is very important because this is going to help you follow the career you want to do.

When you're looking for jobs you have to make the right choice and choose the one that is going to help provide for you and your family therefore, you want to seek someone else's opinions to help you make the right choice. Sometimes it is better for you to make your own decision so you can learn how to do it yourself, but there are some situations where seeking more than one opinion will be the best choice. Everyone has to make difficult choices in their life, by only going off of what you think would be the best choice can be good sometimes, but you might not see what another person can. So you might not see some of the negatives therefore, when you ask someone else you get another persons point of view. It might not always be the best choice for you, but you can see other points of view from different people and that will help you make the right decicsion.

Not all people give good advice you should ask people you know or are trustworthy to give you good advice. Not all things require more than one opinion, but some things do like big decisions. You need to make the right choice. If you want to do something big with your life like become an actor or a singer you have to have advice to become better also not all advice is good advice. If you do want to do something like that you will fail but you have to use that as a learning lesson so when you do it again you can ask people what you should do or ask them for the best advice they can give you to help make you better. So any chance you get try to ask for advice it might not be the best, but you can still learn from it and make a good decision.

When you get other people's opinions you can see what most of them say and you can apply that with what you think. By doing so you make a good decision, but they could also open your eyes up to see something you didn't see before it may be good or it may be bad. They could also make you realize that what you choose might not be the best choice and that there could be something better for you. So you can put your choice to what they think you should do and then you can make the best decision. Your choice can impact you and the ones around you so you have to be smart when asking for advice and do what is best for you and the people around you.

Therefore, you should always ask for advice no matter how big or small it is. You always want to make the right choice and getting other people's opinions is the best way to do so. like when choosing what job you want to take or what career you want to chase after you always want to make the best decision so ask people for their advice. Everyone has to make hard choices in life and they may not know what to do so ask people for advice and do what you think is best.",0
"It is my pleasure to take this great opportunity to express my view or opinion on the above topic; which is positive attitude is the key to success in life?.First and foremost i would like to briefly talk about the term attitude, it can be shorty defined as a good or bad conduct or manner ones shows in public or the kind of act you put up which is either good or bad. If we really take good look at how people live,attitude is the most relevant thing they mostly pay attention to, lets talk about work school.

WORK OR SCHOOL:

If we take good look at this two places, we can see or sort of attitudes aspects, either good or bad that is coming from the students,teachers and many more , showing good attitudes towards others shows how respect you are and what kind of family you came from, most people had a good relationship with others because of their good attitude they have acquire from school or at home,students with good attitude are more easily to associate themselves among others, and become very good friends , teachers really love students who always show a good attitude, sometimes too they can earn some gift from others.

HOME OR CHURCH:

This really take places in our various houses, showing good attitude to your parents or it can anyone ,mostly help to gain favors from people you might not even know they might be your futures helper, because there is a saying nobody knows tomorrow, for instance you went out and some random person ask if you can help him or her to find a place but your attitude did not let him even to ask you anymore ,but imagine some few years later came and you met such same person that ask for your assitance but your attitude was not good at all, maybe he is a manager at your dream job you have prayed to work there, so as soon as you get there you saw he is the one who is going to interview you do you think he will be willing to gave you such opportunity even though you qualified the answer is no he will find any means to let you not get that job , your bad attitude ruin up your whole life, this goes to church too,having positive attitude at church draws human being more closer to God and attract more blessings from him as well.

POSITIVE ATTITUDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS;

Last but not the least is the kind of attitude we gave among ourselves ,this has become a daily rampant that need to failure to get help from other people, imagine you had like 4 close friends but they are be asking for your help on something but some of them attitude is very pathetic , but insisted they really need your help and what you have on you can only help few of them, so would you go ahead and help those who had a negative attitude the answer may be no,because you going to help those of your friends whose had a good attitude first before you assist them too , this really tell us having positive attitude can really gave you so many opportunities or advantages.

THESE ARE SOME MERITS OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE:

1. It creates good interpersonal relationship among individual.

2. It easily to get favor from other people.

3. It always bring peace among others.

4. It really depict the kind of family you came from or the type of trained you have acquired.

THESE ARE SOME VITAL OR MAJOR REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE;

1. B

ecause it enable individuals to always have a good name in any places they found their selves in and, it also promote economic living,

because you individuals really knows good your attitude is so therefore they will always be proud to share their issues or problems with you without been hesitate.

2. It attract blessings from God , because the bible is even against anyone who does not show a positive attitude among his or her neighbor, and can make your life been successful with the help of blessings you getting from your creator.

HOW POSITIVE

ATTITUDE HELP US IN OUR OWN LIVES;

having positive attitude really help individuals a lot because this earth we live in everything is about attitude even assuming you apply for a job and they monitor you for awhile then later realized you had a bad attitude, do you think the person who is in charge of that work will be willing to hired you the answer is no, because no one can hired someone who has a negative attitude, so imagine now you had positive attitude everything is excellent you even feel proud of yourselves you do not even care wherever you might find yourself in because your attitude is really good and it can gave you so many chances in life that you think you not even to have it, you can also become a remodel to some people , they might even look at you and learn from you , so therefore is very good to have a positive attitude and move free wherever you go , some people really pay attention to people attitudes even more than everything in this word.

CONCLUSION;

Due to time factor i would like to bring my above oppinous to an end and i am pretty sure it may be taking into consideraton and publish it for other people to have access to read and if they had to made some changes in their lives they can surely do so to it.

Thank you.                                                                                                                                  ",0
"Phones and driving

Do you think it is worth it to look at your phone while driving? The zebra conducted a national survey of young drivers to determine their perception of texting and driving. 36% of respondents aged 18-24 admitted to texting while driving. Using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should never be done.

One reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you could put yourself at risk of injuring yourself or someone else. Say your driving and you hear your phone's notifications going off you feel the urge to pick up your phone just to see what it is out of curiosity and you Know you shouldn't pick up your phone because you are driving but you still pick it up anyway. That one moment you look up to see a person crossing the street and are lucky enough to press your foot on the brakes in time to stop in the intersection. Consider yourself lucky as you could've injured that person. Things like this can happen which is why you should be more careful when driving.

Second reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you should consider who your riding with whether it be a friend or group of friends or maybe family members you wouldn't want to risk their lives and yours only because you grabbed your phone to look at for a few seconds. You should think twice before reaching for that phone and think about what you do. If they say don't use your phone listen to them and don't think about it focus your eyes on the road. It is not worth all the trouble.

Finally, the third reason you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is it is probably illegal. Almost all the states including some without cellphone prohibit text messaging while driving. In most of these states, you can be pulled over and cited for texting as a primary offense. When on the road be careful what you do and don't think about grabbing your phone even if it's just for a few seconds.

Overall, you should never use your phone while operating a vehicle because it is very dangerous. Remember you could risk injuring yourself or someone else. Consider who your driving with and it is probably illegal depending on the situation.

"out with the old and in with the new. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" - ""the Indefensable Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" from

Mother Jones by Bradford Plumer. The Electoral College needs to be replaced it has too much room for failure, manipulation,and its loose guidelines allow unfair representation.

The Electoral College has too much room for failure considering the only guidlines for electors are those that are not holding office and depending on the state electors are chosen in various ways. the garuntee that electors will vote in favor of majority vote of their state is not garunteed. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprimse...The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meetin of the electorswhere they vote for

President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress."" - ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

The Electoral College allows room for manipulation and as cited in ""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" as ""the single best argument against the

Electoral College"" would be the disaster factor described as the thing that the american people should consieder themselves lucky didnt happen. The articles asks the reader to ""consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Citing an event in 1960 where louisiana attempted to replace electors with others that would vote in their favor and John Kennedy would not have won popular vote. In the event of a tie the election will be passed to the House of Representatives, because each state only gives one vote allowing states with meager population to have the same holding as states that represent millions upon millions and given the information that voters may vote one party to president and another for congress, the house's selection can hardly be reminiscent of the choices of the people that each one person represents.

The Electoral College is unfair because the candidatesknow which states will vote for them and which states definately wont and the ones that they might be able to find their way in favor. for example in ""the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all""-The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong. jeopardising the validity of the entire capaign by putting the votes in the hands of swing voters to see who wins favor with visits to poor elementary schools and weak middle school student council campaigning by promising free ice cream and kissing babies.

The Electoral College needs to be thrown out there is no fixing what is already widely regarded as an anachronism. the Electoral College is a flawed system and maybe in some utopia it might work but not in america it wont there is too much at stake to keep trying to mske it work",0
"Dear Senator, I am writing to you to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out ot you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.

First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to occur over a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidate's share of Electoral College exceeds his share of popular vote. For example, in a article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 percent rodney received. Because of the winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory.

Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winnertakeallmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate to focus campaigning in tossup states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likely to be more thoughtful voters. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by the malapportion,ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

A reason for not keeping the electoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors can be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is that electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the candidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want.

In conlcusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters don't vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting the number of cars on the roads. There are many reasons to not drive as much but there is still a lot of driving. People are taking action in decreasing the number of cars still being driven. There needs to be a smaller number of drivers. Driving isn't a life or death deal, we lived witout it for tens of thousands of years,

There are a lot of reasons to decrease driving numbers. The most important reasons in my opinion are environmental issues. There are so many gases produced my cars such as carbon monoxide that hurt our atmosphere. The air has been filled with pollutants that are devestating our whole world. Too much exposure to certain gases can be fatal. Driving is not worth polluting and hurting our atmosphere.

Many places have alredy taken action in reducing the number of cars on the road. Vuban, a German suburb, has banned the use of personal vehicles. As a result, 70 percent of families who reside in Vuban do not own a car. They simply walk or ride bikes everywhere with only a few buses to transport the citizens. Heidrun Walter says ""When I had a  car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Paris did an experiment with not letting even-number plated cars had to find another way of transportation for one day and odd-number plated cars do the same the next day. Each violator was fined 22 euros or $31. They repeated that cycle for about a week. The amount of smog decreased drastically. Even Bogata has their ""Day Without Cars."" They've held the event for 3 years straight. Violators faced a $25 fine. In result of that, two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined the event.

In the past couple of years there haven't been that many new drivers joining the crowd. A study has shown that there has been a 23% decrease of new drivers between 2001 and 2009. I guess that people don't have the need to drive everywhere now. The number of miles driven was peaked in 2005. Ever since then people have been driving less. We are now at the same number of miles driven as in 1995. People also haven't been buying new cars as often as they used to.

All in all, there are many advantages of driving less. There isn't as much of pollution being created. If we stay on the same track, we can stop polluting the earth with as many harsh gases and chemicals. There would be more healthy wildlife as well. I understand that transportation is a must, but find more ecologically friendly ways to do it such as car pooling or riding the bus or walking. There are many solutions, we just need to find them.",0
"The author has great passion for this topic but has not accomplished on supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danges. The author has many points on how others are trying to solve the problems on how to explore Venus but does not explain why the risk is worthy of exicuting. ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk."" This quote states that scientist need to take a risk but does not give a reason why the risk is neccesary. This is not the only way the author did not accomplish on supporting the idea.

The author explains the history of Venus and its properties but that does not help support the idea. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This quote explains how the risk of exploring and studying Venus was lower ""long ago"" but does not explain or supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. This is not the only way the author does not support the idea successfully.

As a question can be the upbringing or curosity and reasoning, the author seems to not give a response to the question on supporting the idea. ""The value of returning to Venuse seems indisputable, but what are the options of making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" The athour questions possible options on how to get both saftey and productivity, but does not question the risks and possible dangers of exploring Venus. As the passage continues the author only explains the options and possible ways on exicuting the idea but does not include the risks that the options hold.

As the passage is very informative and holds great information, the author supports very poorly the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author explains solutions that are a possobility but does not include the risks of the idea. The author also informs the audience about the history of Venus but boes not help on supporting the idea of studying Venus. The author unfortuntly, poorly supported the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",0

''THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A PROCESS NOT A PLACE THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS A COMPRIMISE BETWEEN ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT BY VOTE IN CONGRESS AND ELECTIION OF THE PRESIDENT  BY A POPULAR  VOTE OF QUALIFIED CITIZENS''.THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF 538 ELECTORS. ALSO EACH CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN YOUR STATEHAS HIS OR HER OWN GROUP OF ELECTORS.

""WHAT HAVE RICHARD NIXON, JIMMY CARTER, BOB DOLE, AND THE US CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND THEIR AFL-CIO ALL, IN THEIR TIME, AGREE ON""?  THE CORRECT ANSWER IS ABOLISHING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. PEOPLE AY THEIR ARE THINGS WRONG WITH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. THAT IS TRUE. ONE OF THE TINGS THAT IS WRONG WITH IT IS ""UNDER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM , VOTERS VOT NOT FOR PRESIDENT, BUT FOR A SLATE OF ELECTOERS, WHO IT Turn elect the president.

these Are what the electoral colleges is and the goods and bads.",0
"This is for the facial recination i say yes to it becuse it can modify the students lesson so that the student is not bored with the lesson. Sure it might cost a little to make this happen for the students but they are this nation future. The program that they are using will let the help out the students to get better grades with other thing .

To help in thir life when they are in math class and they do not understand what is going on the computer will send them a little message to ask them to see what they need help with in the lesson. The program that they were using reconized a 600 year old painting that is all kinds of other things wrong with the painting . they were able to get the stats from the old painting they were 83% happy 9% distigusted 6% fearful 2% angery . The computer will scan all 44 mucle's in ure face that make the emotins that you feel every day. The emotions that you feel in ure day are happy,sad,cheerful,mad, these are some of the emotions that you feel in a normal day in ure life.

The thery of emotions are when you make a face it helps tell how ever that you are feeling. World renowned drama coach Constantin Stanislavsky. He tells his actors to reproduce faces to help them out better with all of there things that they are doing to help them be better actors. In one part of the story it says imagin a computer that imagins when you are sad or happy when and add pops on ure screan and it can tell that you are not interested in the add so it finds better adds when it is time for one to pop up.

Most humans have a nonverble type of way when they see each other. When leaonardo devinchi painted the mono lisa he had information the human body. That he had found out when he was diesecting peapole so that he could find out more. The Computers that he dose with all of these things . The devise all have all of the soft ware on these little electronic codes that help if distiguise between which faces that the person makes when they are happy fear and other.

With having this kind of tech we can do amazing things like figger out who is going to freak out and kill somone or somthing elses that is crazy when peapole go crazy for som odd reasone. This will prpobly save somone life in the long run with this kind of tech that is avalible that we are able to use. With it will give you facial feedback when ever you are using the device that has this program on it that you are able to use with it . these are my reasone for all of theses things.",0
"If a computer in the classroom that can read human emotion's was implemented then it could be a excellent help to students.

Students in a classroom are all very diverse when it comes down to emotion. A teacher may not be able to recognize these emotions and teach a lesson wrong in which a student cannot follow. Say a student was angry or sad toward a test score, the teacher may keep teaching in a way that ignores the way a student is feeling towards the class. With the computer identifying the emotion a teacher may change up teaching methods to help said student.

This latest computer technology was created by Prof. Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois used work of psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman. This technology uses 44 major muscles in the face movement's to create an calculation of what emotion the user is expressing. The computer idientifies the user with six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. By recording the movement of one of the favial muscles the computer can identify a person with any combination of the six emotions. In the painting of Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", the computer calculated, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

This technology can change the way we interact with devices in our everyday activites. Alto says in the article, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""

This kind of selection can improve our experience while browsing the internet. This can help identifying the food we like, clothes we like, trips or hobbies we'd enjoy.

The educational value in this is grand as that using the technology of recognizing emotions, the computer can shift lessons so the student can follow along with. ""A class room computer could recognize when a student is feeling confused or bored, 'Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This can speed up the learning process and change the way the world educates today. The future is now and the future is change.",0
"Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Venus is a planet in the solar system, it is the second planet from the sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin, Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetory neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in venus's atmosphere.

The difference in speed means that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. Because Venus is something right around the corner in the space terms human have sent numerous space craft to land on the cloud-draped world. No space craft survived the landing for more than hours. Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present earthquakes, amd frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface. Venus has the hotest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending human to study venus. NASA's posible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the frays. Srriving to meet our challenge presented by venus has a big value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human currosity will likely lead us into manequally.",0
"Since the industrial revolution the demand for cars has grown. Cars have been needed for transport to go to work, school, or just plain traveling. But recently the demand has decreasing. All around the world ""no car suburbs"" popped up and people are dying to move. In source one a German city named Vauban only have 70 percent of families owning cars while 57 percent sold their cars to move to Vauban. This new trend of no automobiles is said to lessen stress, reduce smog greenhouse emissions, and make cities more accessible. ""America's love affair with its vehicles seem to be cooling"" says source four.

Greenhouse emissions wither away with the less cars that ride up and down streets. In Paris, the typical smog reaches to about ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter"" stated by source two. This makes it harder for traffic to see and causes an unsafe environment for walking. Paris was said to have banned half of cars one day and another half the other and the smog was cleared enough to rescind the no car rule. Greenhouse emissions, like carbon, can cause acid rain, raises the temperature, and can clog up breathing pathways making it unsafe to go outside when the smog is strong. Carbon can be admitted through the fuel of cars. In France, over 50 percent of cars use diesel fuel which causes a greater amount of greenhouse gas emission. If society can walk or ride bikes to work or school then the amount of automobiles needed will decrease. The lessening number of automobiles can help create a safer and healthier environment.

Not only is the 'no car' trend happening in Europe and developed countries but it is happening all around the world. Source three talks about Bogota, Colombia using a no car program. Once a year Colombia participates in a no car day. ""Million of Colombians hiked, bikes, skates, or took busses to work"". The ones that did not were given a 25 dollar fine. This day in Bogota has gotten so popular that people from other countries have traveled just to witness. The idea of no cars can improve city dynamics. Bogota alone has built 118 miles of bycicle paths. The open area away from cars has created room to build parks and sport areas, restaurants, and shopping centers. While the revenue of cars are decreasing these new areas are increasing in revenue. If using no cars for a day can have this large of an impact in a developing country than it must create a big impact for developed countries.

Even though a no car program can be a huge benefit there are still people disagreeing. A growing crime rate can make it not be safe enough to walk or ride a bycicle to work. For some, work may be to far away to create a short enough walk or ride. Some places, like here in Florida, does not have a transit station close by. But even the idea of carpooling can lessen the the use of cars. Picking up just a couple of friends on the way to work or school can lessen the amount of cars on the road. This can create less traffic and carbon emissions and is safer than walking or riding a bike alone. While some argue that the demand for cars has shrunk due the recession it can also be said that cars may not be the top priority. Source four states that between 2001 and 2009 the amount of young adults driving had decreased by 23 percent.

Wether your on your way to work, school, or practice it would be smart to find another way of transportation. If your new years resolution was to get fit and go to the gym, ride your bike or run to work. Bicycling and walking can create a healthier you. Cars have done more harm that good to the environment but it is not too late to change that. We can use places like France, Germany, and Colombia as a great example of a new way to change life. Lets do ourselves a favor and maybe pick up a buddy on the way to work, or ride a bike, take the train, or walk. Lets take part in the new trend of no automobiles.",0
"Dear Senator,

We the people of the United States of America, desire a president who will not only care for the wellbeing of the citizens, but know what to do during times of crisis. The Electoral College is but one method of deciding this. There are many reasons as to why we need the Electoral College, and there are many reasons one can list of why we do not need it. If we were to get rid of the Electoral College completely and determine the win on the vote of the American citizens, chaos would ensue. Let's be honest, there are plenty of voters who have no idea what they are doing. If America were to base who would lead and call the shots of the country on the votes of everybody, then one person would end up being in office who is no better a ruler than a goldfish.

The Electoral College is noted as a process, not a place. This is correct. You don't just walk up to the Electoral College and say ""hey, this is who you should put into office"". Each state in the U.S. has a certain number of representatives(electors). For example, D.C.(is treated like a state) has 3 electors. People may say that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. While in some aspects this can be true, but if the electors know what they are doing and are willing to stay true to their country, then maybe the correct person would be elected in. The EC is known to require a Presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A trans-regional appeal is when one area of the U.S. is known to be in favor of the presidential candidate.

Among the other things the Electoral College is known as being, it has been widely regarded as an anachronism. An anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not fit into the present time. While yes, the Electoral College is very old, it does have its uses. It is perhaps one of the final things that will determine what direction this great country gets set into, be it forwards or backwards. The larger the population of a state, the larger number of electors it has. Most of the states in the U.S. have what is called a ""winner takes all"" system. This system will award all of the electors to the presidential candidate that wins the election.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, what is known as the AFL-CIO, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce all agreed on just one thing. That thing that they all agreed on was to abolish the Electoral College. Over sixty percent of the U.S. population would rather have a direct election  over what we currently use. Out of all the arguments against the Electoral College, one of the ""best"" is the Disaster Factor. One of the other worrying views on the Electoral College is what would occur if there were to be a tie in the vote. If a tie were to occur, the election would thus be thrown in the hands of the House of Representatives.

While there are many reasons to like, and dislike the Electoral College, one of the most re-assuring should be that it (most of the time) will keep idiots out of the Oval Office. Among the reasons to dislike the Electoral College is that it is unfair, and keeps the majority of American people from using their voice. The Electoral College is the fine line between a country going backwards and causing the rest of the world to hate it, and a country going forwards, causing the rest of the world to hold it to a higher degree. If theres anything that the American people should want, it is a powerful and respectable leader who will do anything and everything they can for the citizens. Sincerely,

An American.",0
"You may wonder why you haven't seen people using their cars lately. This is because those citiznes have realized the advantages of limited car usage. There are many valid reasons why using a car is not the way to go when it comes to transportation.

In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""...Life Goes on Without Cars"" she talks to Heidrun Walter who has amited to the fact ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" citizens become happier when they aren't using a car as a way of transportation. Life without cars can make you happier, isn't that what everyone want - to be happy? And this is just one way to do so.

There are more advantages to limited car usage than you think. We prevent smog ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" We all hate how annoying smog can be, so all we have to do is the stop using cars as much and we won't see the thing we hate anymore. Even if you think that your city will only be prevented from smog, others will as well.

While there are disadvantages to the fact of not having a car, but isn't there more advantages to not having an Earth to live on? That's right, if we treat the Earth like we are now and using cars so much out ""home"" will be destroyed all thanks to humans like us. In Robert Duffer's article about smog bans he states ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", so if we take the example of Paris we can stop pollution and prevent losing our home.",0
"Dear state senator, We should not decide the president by electoral college. Mainly because it's unfair to the voters who took the time out of their day to vote, but then realized they wasted their time because their vote doesn't mean anything, the electors decide who the president is not the voters. The article the Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong states ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote for not the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What's the point of voting if our vote basically doesn't matter because we are not the one choosing who is president. The same article also states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" We the voters basically don't even decide who's president, the electors do, and we don't even get to pick who the electors are, the state legislatures do. Why is the president based off of who the electors want? there's only 538 of them, it should be based off popularity, the vote of the millions of the people who have voted. Honestly i see no point in voting now since our votes don't decide who the president will be.

Electoral college is unfair to the small states. The article five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' shows a map of America with the number of electoral votes given to each state. If you look at the map, you'll notice that the bigger states have more electoral votes, and the small states have very few. For example California has 55 electoral votes, Texas has 38, and Florida has 29. But states such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine have less than 5 electoral votes. Which basically means that their electoral votes don't count nearly as much as the big states do. If we decided the president by popularity among everyone who voted, it would actually be fair to everyone, and more people would vote.

The article five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' states ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" I don't blame them when the artcile also states ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose presidency."" Then what's the point of voting when our vote doesn't matter.",0
"Do you think it is important to seek out advice from more than one person?

When found in a situation, many people ask others for their advice during the situation to very the outcome. If you ask more than one person for their advise or opinion on how to handle something, you will get multiple different answers. That should make the situation easier to handle, because you can see how it might end if you choose a certain way to deal with it. Someone you ask for advice from might have been in the same situation you are in, and can help you handle it. But you won't know if they have been in the same situation if you don't ask multiple people.

Asking multiple people for advice can, help you with a delimia, get you different opinions from different standpoints on a situation, and can make sure you are making a wise decision instead of an impulsive one.

You have a job at a retail marketing company as the social media manager, making 13 dollars and hour, have only been working for them for 4 months, and is only a 15 minute drive from your house. But there is another job offer, it is also a retail market company, but you would handle finances, and get paid 22 dollars an hour, and it is the next state over and is a 3 hour drive, you have all of your family here and just bought a house, your degree is in consumer finances. What do you do? You seek advice from a lot of people, get their opinions, see which one is better for you future, and make a decision off of the advice given to you. Remember, get multiple peoples' advice and opinions to make a wise decision instead of an impulsive one.",0
"Ever need help and need some great advice. I agree with asking multiply people for advice. Asking multiply people for advice can give you different ideas on how to deal with that certain topic, you'll have multiply point of views, and if you talk to someone who has dealt with that topic in the past they can give you great advice because they've dealt with it in the past and now how to handle with it.

Asking multiply people for advice can give you multiply and different point of views. You'll be able to look at all the options and see which ones you like the most; dislike the most. If they all gave you different advice, you'll have multiply ways to handle with that topic. If all the people you asked for advice are trustworthy then you'll have great judgment.

If you talk to someone who's dealt with that certain topic before, they can give you great advice. They'll have a great background on that topic. If you ask multiply people; and they give you the same advice then you'll know its great advice, and you'll know which route to take. They can give you multiply ideas and you can choose which one you like the most.

I feel that if you're having any trouble and need advice go for it, its useful. Especially if something is going on in your life that's where advice comes in handy.",0
"Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. Therefore, a revolutionary idea has been spreading around the world: using personal automobiles less. The new aspect of using cars less has promoted a happier society, a cleaner environment, and an open attitude towards alternative transportation.

First of all, by establishing an agreement to decrease car use, people have been said to be happier and stressfree. The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this carfree community when she states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal. By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual carfree day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the carfree day is ""a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Selsky. As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude.

With a smaller amount of people using their personal vehicles, less gas emissions are becoming a part of the Earth's atmosphere. Humans breathe in the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from it. The environment suffers from the dirty air and may not be able to sustain life if there is not a stop to the large amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air. In the United States, passenger cars are the cause of ""up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions while in Europe they are ""responsible for 12 percent"" Rosenthal. This means that the car use in the United States is ruining the air around us and assists greatly in creating a disgusting environment. In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars: ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Chicago Tribune. To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically. Therefore by promoting a system where car usage is not as common, the environment can become healthier and cleaner, which benefits the citizens of the Earth.

Last, declining the use of cars creates an open attitude towards alternative transportation methods. Those who live in carfree communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will carpool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses"" to get where they needed to be Selsky. Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives ""around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends"" Rosenthal. Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world.

In conclusion, a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stressfree society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.",0
"Sure driving your car is the fastest and most convenient way to reach your desired destination. But is it the most friendly to the environment? The answer is no. Decreasing the amount of vehicles permitted on publis streets would greatly help reduce this issue. Driving an automobile is very harmful for Earth. Many countries have been trying to decrease the amount of vehicles on the streets.

In Vauban, Germany, the residents have almost completely given up driving. Home garages, street parking, and driveways are forbidden here. The roads are completely car free except for public transportation. Car ownership is allowed, with the consequence of paying $40,000 for a spot to park, along with a house. Vauban's ideas are being adopted around the world.

Over in Paris, partial driving bans have been enforced to help prevent the build up of smog. Every Monday drivers with even-numbered license plates are not permitted to drive. The same rules applied to people who drove vehicles with odd-numbered license plates on Tuesday. If they failed to follow their orders they will be fined with with a 22-euro, or $31, fine. About 4,000 motorists were fined and a recorded 27 had their vehicles impounded because of their ractions to the fines. Because of the warm days and cold nights, car emissions were trapped under the warmer layer of air. Enough smog cleared on Monday so they dropped the Ban for Tuesday.

Bogota, Columbia had a program which involved millions of Columbians skating, hiking, biking, etc. This was during a ""car-free day"" where only public transportaion was allowed. Their goal is to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. Any violators were fined $25. Other Columbian cities such as Cali and Valledupar eventually joined the event. Since then, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed.

There are many ways to reduce the amount of gases released into the atmosphere. Limiting the amount of automobiles permitted on the streets is one of the biggest ways to solve this issue. If everyone would join in on these events we could restore what we have taken away from the environment.",0
"They should be able to work with each other they can do this program so that the schools have new students. If new students are having difficult time in this school,classes,people then they should send someone to help them out a little. Everyone had some hard time getting used to the school being shy in all, they get the other older students to assist the younger ones. Programs that pairs older with younger, some younger kids gets used to a new school thats hard for them, if they have trouble in classes. the older and younger kids could be able to work with each others.

It's hard getting used to a new school for other people seeing new people,new classes getting to know other people,making new friends, and everyone gives time for the school. For some people it could be easy for the others really hard whether it's elementary, middle , high school thats hard getting ti know the school. Say we get a bad grade and they try so hard to get the perfected score. But they studied so hard to get a good grade. So they assist someone.

So the schools created these things to help other students if they are having troubles with there grades, their classes, assist the students get there grades up so they can get better and better. They help each others for reasons to get a good grade. Its good that each schools are doing this to help pther students. They can get a school a chance make new friends get better in school and then they could help other students to get good grades this is a good program for the other students. ",0
"Cellphones

People should not use their phones while driving because it is a huge safety hazard with many deadly consequences. Another reason, it puts the people that don't have car insurance at risk as well. People in America fall to realize the amount of damage they do when doing something so dangerous to ourselves and to other people. People who don't care about their own lives would do an action like this.

It's basically a safety hazard when it comes don't to situations like this. For example in 2019 there were over 55,000 accidents over the country every day and it's because a person is on his or her phone. Events like this puts people in America in panic, especially new drivers. Also another fact actions like this as increases the death rate in America which makes the country look bad. Then it also uses a lot of our resources to repair the damage to the car or for the factory to make more cars.

Car accidents are expensive to not just the people but also to their car insurance. Being in a car accident can affect your money which isn't a good if you're the type of person that having a hard time in life. People don't think about the consequences just by texting and driving. That person that caused the accident just by taking his eyes off the road could take a life or ruin someone's life. I believe that people don't need phones while their driving unless it's being used for good reason, like for example the GPS. Anything else shouldn't be allowed to protect the people and keep our taxes from going up because of these rates.",0
"When asking for advice, it is important to talk to multiple people so you can get different opinions. Getting different opinions helps the person make a wise choice, instead of making a rash decision and using only one person's opinion. Asking for advice is basically doing research, because for both you use multiple opinions, whether from people, websites, or books, to conduct smart research or to make a good decision. For example, if I was doing an essay for school, I would use multiple websites and many different books on my topic so that my essay would be factual and outstanding. If all of my information came from one source, my essay may not be as factual because I would not have any other source to compare it to. Doing research is similar to asking for advice because if I wanted to know what people thought about a certain restaurant, I would get multiple opinions by asking friends and reading reviews online.

Having multiple opinions makes the person more knowledgeable about what they are seeking advice for. For example if you were thinking about buying a hand soap, you would probably ask for advice before you bought the hand soap. If you asked a friend that had received a defected bottle, they may tell you that the product is terrible because of their experience with the product. But if you ask another friend who had a great experience with the hand soap, they will probably tell you how terrific the soap is and how beautiful it smelled. The person that had a bad experience will be biased to say that the product is bad, but the review is the opposite for the person that had a great experience with the hand soap.

I have personally made the mistake of not seeking advice from multiple people when I decided to buy a pair of shoes. I had asked a friend what his thoughts were on a pair of shoes and he said that they were great. I then asked him if I should wait to see if they go on sale, but he said the shoes were so amazing that I should buy a pair right away. So I bought the shoes at the store, and when we returned a week later, the shoes were discounted for 20%. If I had asked for multiple opinions on whether I should or shouldn't buy the pair of shoes I may have saved $15 that day. That event always reminds me to seek advice from many people to receive multiple viewpoints and make a wise decision.",0
"Firstly, I think the politics a good thing.

However some people feel that requiring, I belive a person can change traits, aslo has a great politic, so many people wants to be a good person, but maximun of the people are good and bad. So we need to be a good peron every time. With your mom, dad , brother, teacher, friends, grandmother. with your's adults, we need to follower the rulers.

Secondly, character traits such as can be kindess chose, for exemplo my friend this morning and last nigth, they both asked can other for things and instead for of becaing a horrible person. alway we need to be nice with another persons, we need to be honest, aslo when we have a horrible friends we need to be nice with them. also when we have the opportunitly to help peple,

Prompt-My prompt is explain to people why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice

Seeking muitipule opinions is a better choice beacsue you can get a bunch of diffferent opinions and they most likey will have a better point of view. Its better to have mutilple choice then just having one choice or opinions now for some examples Example one If a student is having issuse at home they have mutiple opinions which are 1. talk to a counsler 2. talk to the school social worker 3. talk to a trusted adult 4. talk to a friends parent 5. talk to other family members..

example two a lady haves a few job offers but he goes for one and thinks he not going to pass the interview but he stll has a few jobs lining up behind him the job offers are1. sceintest at nasa 2. host on the ellen show 3. a buisness owner.

I also feel like asking one person would not be the best choice bescause what if they dont have have the best opinions or best advice,i feel like for the bst advice ask more then one person make sure the person is trustable make sure the person knows what they are talking about.

To make sure this trusted person know what they are talking about ask them a few quetions iif they answer them right then they might be a person you can trust

If your the one taking to the kid or adult going having issues have patince with them its probroly a hard topic for them     ",0
"Their are so many things you can do to help keep the envierment safe to live in. Some countys world wide have already started taking these procations to protect the earth. The thing these countries have decided to change in their everyday life is to take cars away or start limiting the use of them. Now this might sound like a big deal but their are many advantages to this appeal of motor use.

Some advantages of cars being limited or just not used at all, would mean we would be saving more money. Just think about all the money you throw away to put it towards your car. Their are bills, repairs, new car if you get into a bad acident, ect. The list just goes on and on. Their could be so much more you could spend your money on and it could make are economy richer.

In source 3: car-free day is sprinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky it states that "" In Bogota people who violated the car usage would be faced witha fine of $25"". This is another way of showing you how much money you are wasting on your car.

Another advantage to not owning or using a car would be the pollution levels in the earths atmosphere would go down. In sourse 2:paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer it states that ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a parital driving ban to clean the air of the global city"". Now the people of the world should have never let pollutin get this bad. The french more of paris had smog (a type of pollution) for at least a week. In sourece 4: the end of the car culture by Elizabeth Rosenthal it states that ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was on January 1995"". So the cars limitations is actually helping lower the number of miles which means the pollution rate is also going down.

Their are many advantages to not using or at least limiting the use of a car. such as reducing the money that is spent on one which wouls help the economy out. Also reducing the the polluction that cars produce. These are just some of the small advantages that come with the reduction and limitations of cars in the world we live in today.",0
"Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person.

Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didn't know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know.

People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. When I came here I thought I wouldn't learn english and that I wouldn't have friends, but then I thought ""If I don't start practicing or trying to learn I won't be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldn't understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. I would be stuck if I hadn't try.

My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didn't know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesn't know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doens't mean that's all she can do.

Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didn't know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesn't mean you can't do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doens't mean it didn't work, it mean something went bad and you don't need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do. Experiences make people better, growing makes people better, trying makes people better, all person are capable of doing what they want. ",0
"The use of this Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would make the kids and the teacher feel very weird. This sytem should not be used in the classroom, why would want a progam to determed our emtions in the class.

In the article it say that "" imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad"" don't think that would be wrong, nobody wants a system to tell them how they feel. That is like telling someone if they are ugly or not. Having this in a class would just cause the kids to be happy and try to not show emtions. This facial coding system might great but not for the student or people.

In the aricle it says "" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face of all 44 major muscles"" That means that all the muscles in the body would have to work. The use of this technology to read our emotions is not right on there part giving that peole have to show how they feel aleady. Don't think we need a program to tell us how we feel. This woulds be a waste of this coding not a way for people to feel, making them not to show emtion or any feeling.

The coding system can show six basic emotions they are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This machine can tell you how you feel, believe that taking away our way of expessing ourself. A way of hsowing how we can as people show how we feel nobody wants a machine to tell us.

This facial coding system sounds cool and what a great idea to have something telling us wha we are feeling. But not a good idea that be taking away the human emotions we can express on our own. Taking away something as a human we need to use in the articel it say "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". What that mean or sound like to you, it sounds like we can tell our pown emotion.

In conclusion feel that we should not have this facial coding system in our school or anywhere else at that. This article is telling us how good the coding works on the way we are feeling. But what it is not telling us is that how would you feel if something was just scanning your face and telling you how you feel. Its not something that people need in school , its like saying the minute you walk into somewhere there the system scanning your fae to see how you feel. Believe can already tell how you feel because we all share the same emotions , happy , sad , angry, fear, disgust etc. So no facial coding system should tell me how we are feeling not even if its the in the world.",0
"Have you ever wondered about what would happen if you did something you knew that was bad, or good. What would have been the outcome. If you didn't really know then would't you ask someone like a friend, a family member, a trusted adult, or maybe all three of them. They would give you some sort of advice but it's not all the same sort of advice. When getting advice from different people they would tell you something they experienced or their biased on, but it would all give you some sort of idea.

Imagine you have a project to do about something, but you don't know anything about it. If you wanted to find out about you would go research. When you research you see all sorts of websites filled with information that you could use. When you open these websites you see that they don't all have the same type of information. When you keep reading these different websites you get an idea about what it's about. It's the same thing with finding advice. You don't get the same advice from everyone, but it gives you an idea which is the similarity with all the advice given to you.

People deal with all sorts of things. It could be a job they had, a problem they suffered from, a crime they made, a honorable thing they did to the community. People had experience all sorts of things. When seeking advice, people first think of the experiences they had with that sort of topic. Then they tell you something based on their experience like what would happen, and what the outcome of it would be. People would say all sorts of things based on their experience because it something they experienced. People could experience the same things but in different ways, which could create the idea of some sort of advice.

Everyone has something that they like, it could be some sort of food, video game, bored game, book, TV show, movie, and sport team. Peoples opinion would be either they do like it, or they don't like it. They are reasons do like certain things, and there are reasons people don't like certain things. People are just being biased on things. It's like when you get advice from multiple people. They would be biased on their advice that they give. They would tell you should do this, or do that, but they are just being biased, and you have a choice on listening to it or not.

In conclusion when seeking advice from multiple people, they would all give you some idea of something, and how this happens is cause they all have different opinions but they all tell you something similar. How to know you are going to get some sort of advice that would really help. Depends on how much you trust each other, and how much you care for each other. People could just tell you whatever they want. That is why you should get advice form someone you know is trust worthy.",0
"I guess it's a good idea Because it helps the students to complete their homework with support from other people, with this club it will help a ton of students that has trouble or problems with their homework.

This will be a great idea for many students that has trouble doing their homework at home or doesn't understand or their stuck on their homework, but the other reason people don't want to add this club to the school is they don't like the idea of having it they say ""it's a waste of time for us"" or other more things that they say, some other students might say they don't have time for it or they don't wanna join the club. But it is a good idea to add this club for the students who don't understand how to do their homework, if other people don't wanna join they could just get a bad grade for not doing their homework. If you join the club for sure you will get a good score for doing your homework and probably get good grades for doing your homework because it helps you learn or practice at home for a test or a quiz, so maybe its a good idea to add this club to the school after school probably a few days, because it will be easy to complete your homework everyday and turn it in everyday if you join the club. If you join the club you could finish your homework early then your other classmates, if you do complete your homework early you could have free time at your house and not do any work cause you complete your homework early and not worry about doing work at home cause you already completed your work.",0
"There are always peple saying that aliens are alive and maybe that there is going to be an alien invasion. In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a ""a Viking photo."" I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.

I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. In paragraph 2, the author states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing. In the introduction, it says, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa."" If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.",0
"Dear, senator the Electorial College should be riden of. The people do not have much of a vote. We actaully vote for our candidates electors, the defenses of the system is wrong, and the winner-take all system is unfair. The people should make their own decisions and not be fooled about it.

We are told our vote counts. We have been fooled. We do not vote for the president directly. We vote for the state of electors who elect the president. These electors are our candidates electors. The electors could turn the other way and vote for the other candidate. It almost happened in 1960. The Office of the Federal Register states that the Louisiana legislature almost used new electors for the Demeocratic electors who would have opposed John F. Kennedy. He would have not had a popular vote. So, ask yourself, who do we really vote for?

The defenses of sytems is a joke. The most popular vote of a candidate should be who wins. The Office of the Federal Register described a situation in 2000 Al gore won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. It is a shame that this can happen. Now, ask youself, why can we not have the say on who is president?

Candidates do not spend any time in states they think will not win due to the winner-take-all system. Their main focus are on the ""swing"" states. As if we do not matter. The Office of the Federal Register says in the year 2000 campaign seventeen of the states did not see the candidates, and twenty-five of the largest media markets did not see a campaign add at all. Again, think about it and ask yourself, do we really matter?

It is not fair that we are underminded and fooled. we should have a say and not the electors. The people should have the power. The electorial College is outdated and should be riden of. It is our time.",0
"Each person's lives are all different.

The multiple opinion can make better choice by thinking what you didn't thought before. And we can consider advantage and disadvantage based on their experience,knowledge,and environment.

People can decide the view of the opinion based on person's experience and person who asked a question will have opportunity to consider about all opinion to make better choice. Each person has different experience. And they use their experience to decide the best choice. For example if person wants to do bungi jump and ask people whether to do or not. And if the person whose answering this question had tried bungi jump and felt that it's fun,that person will say it was fun so do it. But if the person whose answering this question saw the news about accident while bungi jumping,that person will say it's dangerous so don't do it.

People has different opinion based on their knowledge and the person who asked the question,will have opportunity to consider about the safest choice. Each person has different knowledge. And and based on the their knowledge,people decide whether the opinion is appropriate or not. For example if the person went to mountain and found the mushrooms. And he or she was very hungry,he or she asked to people whether to eat or not. And if the person whose answering the question don't know about the mushrooms,will say you can eat it. And if the person whose answering this question knows well about mushroom cause he was interested about it,will say they might be poisonous so don't eat it.

People consider different things based on their environment and the person who asked the question,will have opportunity to decide which is the best choice. Each person has different environment that they are living. And environment can make opinion that are the best and also for the future. For example,if the person wants to buy a expensive item so he or she asked to people whether buy or not. And if the person whose answering this question was having allowance every month from their parents,will say buy it because you wanted and your parents will give allowance next month. And if the person whose answering this question are working by him or her selves to earn money,will say no because you need to save it for the future.

So the multiple opinion will help someone to make better choice by all different people's experiences,knowledge,and environment. And help someone to consider with more opinions that help to think more deeper.",0
"What if we could tell how all of the people us were without even asking. Most people can tell when someone is sad, happy, or mad just by looking at them, but what happens when that person is hiding how they are truely feeling. What then? Well new techonlogy can allow us to see exctly how someone, who is trying to hide there emotions, is feeling. This is unfair for many reasons. The technology may be cool but people have a right to keep how they are feeling a secert.

The computer software works by making a 3-D computer model of the face; the computer watches the different muscles in the face move to identify how the person is feeling. The technolgy delevopted by Dr. Huang can even calculate mixed emotions with the exact percent of how strong the emotions are. Dr. Huang obseres that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" I htought people expressed emotions in different ways though? Dr Hoang also states that ""even though individuals often show verying degrees of expression.""

People have a right to not tell people how they are feeling. Did we really need to know the Mona Lisa was 9 percent disgusted? Now that raises the question of why? Was Leonardo de Vinci's hair messed up? Or did she think he needed to take a shower? What is the point in knowing someone is feelings without knowing why? We do not need technology to ask someone how they are feeling. or even why the are feeling the way they are feeling that way.

There are really no benfits to knowing how someone is feeling without knowing why. The technology is very cool. It is crazy how Dr Huang was able to develope a computer that uses muscle movment to idenitfy emotions. The technology is useless though unless you are prepare and willing to ask why?",0
"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. It affects your mental health. It effects your environment. It effects people and companies economically, too. These articles provide a lot of information, and I'm going to use examples from the text to show you.

First, limiting car usage affects peoples mental health. Most people say it makes them happier using different modes of transportation.

""""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two,..."" This is an example from the 1st article, in German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elizabeth Rosenthal.

""""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" Here's another example, from carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota written by Andrew Selsky. Although some people are mad having to use a bus or a train with other people, it's a good stress reliever not having to drive all the time and not having to deal with the road rage.

Second, limiting car usage effects the environment. Cars give off gas that's not good for the Earth. The gas from the cars creates smog in some parts of the world.

""Paris typically has more smog than any other European capitals..."" In that quote from paris bans driving due to smog written by Robert Duffer, it shows that the smog is having an affect of them. Safety is also something that would be increased if we limited car usage.

""""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."""" With less cars around, people would be less likely to get hit. Right now, many people die every day from a car accident or a hit and run. If we lessen the amount of cars on the road, we'd also improve road rage and traffic flow.

Finally, limiting the amount of car usage would effect people and companies economically. People wouldn't have to pay for gas as much as they would have to. It would help out public transportation companies, like the company that runs the Lynx busses or the Line' in Chicago. It would cause a decline in autoinsurance companies and car companies that sell the cars.

""...companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle."" This quote from the article 'The End of Car Culture' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, shows that car companies are trying to stay ahead of their competition. They're trying to appeal to people who prefer bikes or buses rather than a personal vehicle.

""...recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" In this quote from the same passege, it shows that we're already nearing this goal. Car usage is already being limited by the newer generations of people who care about the planet and find it easier to bike or use public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting the usage of cars would help a lot. I think that helping the environment would really be good for us as people. Limiting the usage of cars would make it safer to walk around and bike outside, even drive. It helps people economically even though it hurts certain companies economically. It also helps us mentally by helping us be less stressful and calming down more easily. It would reduce road race as well as certain stress alltogether.",0
"using technology like facial readingd to see what a student is feelingsin the classroom is a big step in history. i think its a fantastic idea. sometimes we humans casnt tell the difference friom a ginune or facke emotion. this computer system bybasses all of that and gets right down to business and tells us whats real and whats fake. using this new technology is a need for schools. i sometimes lie about not needing help or if im stuggling with a problem i normally skip over it or not ask for help. these facial readers reduce let the teachers know how i would be feelings and they could come to me and ask if i needed anything. the sarticle states that is the computer could tell how the student was feeling it could help the student learn by switching up problems and making it a better learning experience for the student. it could read the emotkons if studfents when they are having a tough time during a problem or when they are doing well with the emotions it reads.

the technology would benefit students because when they need help the technology either helps the teacher know whats wrong or helps the student with a better and more accurate learning experience.",0
"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.",0

"The use of cars today in our modern world is crazy! Everywhere you look there's cars going down the road, parked in a garage, or on TV. Now think of a world without them...it would be different, wouldnt it? Yes, indeed it would be, the world would be less hectic and cleaner place to live.

First, Life without cars would make life much less hectic. In Vaunban,Germany there is an upscale community where there are no cars. People either walk, ride bikes or take the public tram. A survey shows ""70 percent of Vanuban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". People move to Vauban to enjoy a ""carfree""...stress free life. ""Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" source 1 paragraph 3 The ""carfree"" world of not having to worry about car payemrnt, insurance, and gas money is a whole lot better than a car dependent world.

Second, Limiting our car use would help make this planet cleaner. Pollution issues have gotten so bad that ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Source 2 paragraph 10 In paragraph 14 it states that ""after fivedays of intensive smog...the smog rivaled Beijing,China, which is one one of the most polluted cities in the world"". France uses more diesel than gasoline, therefore making up 67 percent of all vehicles in France. The use of these harsh fossil fuels is a huge problem that can help be controlled by limiting our use of automobiles.

Third, Although some may argue that we need cars to fuction in our modern world, there are other options that we can choose. For example, If everyone took public transportation such as the subway we would be cutting back tremendously on the amout of feul consumed. Another advantage of using other forms of transportation other than a car would be that you wouldnt have to worry about your car not starting, or not having enough money too fill your tank. Other forms of transportation would always be reliable and convenent. You would also feel good about helping the enviornment by not adding extra gases to the ozone.

To finish up, Limiting our use of cars would make life easier and cleaner. In source 3 it states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. Many people are convinved that a ""carfree"" life would be much nicer than the hectic carconsumed life we've all grown so accustom too. Limiting our use of cars is a good idea for our stressful lives.",0
"The Electoral College is not fair and should be abolished. Did you know that 60 percent of voters would prefer a more direct way to vote then what we have now. That is a lot of people who just want a more trustworthy and direct voting process. The Electoral College should be abolished because you can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all.

Having your trust in people who you only see campaigns for on television is pretty hard to do. Honestly that is quite ridiculous for them to ask of us. In source 2, paragraph 11, Plumer tells us about how sometimes ""faithless"" electors disregard their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. So is it really worth going through the trouble of electing poeple who might not even do as they said they would. Posner on the other hand explains that the trust in the elector is rarely betrayed source 3, paragraph 16. But is it really worth risking four, maybe eight years of our lives to trust poeple we really do not know. Not to mention how it could affect our jobs and lives at home if this does happen.

Did you know seventeen states didn't see any candidates at all in the 2000 campaign. In source 2, paragraph 13, Plumer talks about how candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win. This leaves many states who do not get to see any candidates at all. This makes those states feel like their votes do not count and worry if they their new president willl have any regards for their interest. In source 3, paragraph 19, Posner says that this is a good thing that candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win because then that candidate can focus on the states that may be undecided or swing states. He believes this is a good thing because a candidate with appeal in only a few states is unlikely to be a good president. But you are leaving out a big proportion of the United States population who would love the expiernce of hearing a cadidate give a passionate speech about why heshe should be elected.

We can come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished because you really can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all, which then makes them feel worthless. Furthermore, we can say that the new way to elect the president should be more direct and fair.",0
"PROMPT

In my opinion, prompt is a something positive attitude in our life, and I agree with that because we have to learn how to be prompt. Next, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because we can go far with that, for example: In my future I can get my goals and get everything in my life, that is, a car, a big house, and things like that. Then, I agree with the positive attitude, that is something important to do and to have a better life. Also, my idea is, if we are positive in our life, we can get a lot of success with our goals.

I can follow these list to see what I can do to a positive attitude.

Do something interesting

Search something new

Talk with a trust friend

After that, some people disagree to a positive life because I think they don't have something in their life, like a good future. Something interesting,

a prompt help us to do everything fast but is not good,

because can happened something bad.

A positive attitude is the key to success in life because that's something important we have to do, if don't do something good we don't have a better life, we stay in the same way, for instance, each day we have to know new things, for this reason a agree whit that. I believe to success in life because I can get a lot opportunities. In my opinion to have a positive life, we can relax, read books, listen to music, go out to walk or talk with some good person, these can help us to forget the problems or something bad in our life. Be positive is something can help you to do what you want in your life, and other people to be positive.

Later on, my mom said, I have to be always positive and try any thing new, I think that is true because some times when I can't do something, I try do it like 3 times, after three times I can to everything to myself, so that's a good idea to try every thing what we can't do.

A prompt is something what can we do fast and done quickly. Prompt can help us to get everything done early but sometimes can happen something bad, so have to always care and think what we going to do first.

In conlcution prompt, I agree with that statement becuase I like to get everything done and get something better.",0
"Cars may have some advantages, but the world, would be a better place if we limited car useage. The benifits of limiting our usage of cars is, it will help improve the enviornment, there are healthy alternitves, and not useing cars as much will decrease stress that people have.

Decreasing our car usage will emprove the environment. In the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""  In France they banned even numbered liscence plates from driving, for one day, and one day was all it took for the high levels of smog to decrease. In another Artical ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal it talks about the decrease usage of cars throught the years, paragraph 34 says "" If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" If the people keep slowing down on using cars, which scientist believe it will, there will be better carbon e,issions in the air, and the air will be better. Limiting car usage will help make our environment better.

Walking, biking, and skateing are all excercises that help you stay fit, but they are also a healthy alternative to cars. A artical published in the

Seattle Times called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky describes the day that is trending all over the world, the day cars are banned. People in these countries, in this case Colombia ""hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work"" Banning car usage enchourages people to get up and walk, run, or bike because they can't use their car. In the town Vauban, Germany a car free town, people walk everywhere, because the town has no cars. In the town ""...where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" The people in this town are walking and staying fit everyday.

One last benifit of limited car usage is it causes people less stress. Heidrun Walter , a mother of two who lives in Vauban, Germany, says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now."" Once Walter sold her car she was relived, she didn't have to worry about making her next car payment, when she would have to get gas again, or how much money gas was. Getting rid of her car relived her stress. Not using cars will decrease the amount of stress in society.

Over all, limiting are car usage would greatly benifit us, it will help keep the environment clean, keep our people healthy, and it will cause people less stress.",0
"Have you ever wondered why seeking more than one person for advise is better than asking from one person. More than one person is always good especially when you are looking for advise. Also you can get more answers than from one person. Seeking advise from more than one person is better than just one person because one you have more answers to listen to, also different people to get advise from.

First there are more answers to your problems when you have more people . First they can give you better advise than one person. One person can give you advise but with multiple people they have different perspectives than one person. Secondly it is more help full than one person like I just said more than one person can help you more because of how different they are and how they think. Also more people that you can ask the better advise you can take back from and you will probably make better choices .

There are a lot of people you can get advise from like your friends for example. Your friends are like family and they probably know you a lot maybe not better than you parents but they know how to help you when you need it. The second person you can ask for advise can be your mom she probably knows yo the best out of every one and she knows what is best for you and what is not best for you. Lastly the last person you should get advise from is your school counselor. Your counselor can give you advise maybe not as good as your parents but they can give you some great advise so you can make better choices. All of those different people can help you with your problems and will give you great advise.

in conclusion I think having more than one person to get advise from is better than just one person. More people in general is better than one person and mostly for advise. After reading this essay do you think that you will ask more than just one person for advise in the future ?",0
"Althogh some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Nevertheless is it not a good idea for students, because they tired more early, bring more focus on some classes but not in the others, and they not take a break on summer.

They can be tired more early because some time they worry for the work that they have . For example, students pass more time study and not take a break. Most students going to school sleep because in the night they study for exams, or make some proyect that they left. most of them have many homework and they not finish on time because they are tired and need to sleep to going with energy on the school though they are not finish the homework. In concept the students need more time to make the school work because if they take the offer to graduate in three years they need to give everything on time.

Most of them bring more focus on some classes that others because they think that some classes are more important and the others not. Nevertheless the grades can be going down for the reasons that the students not put attention on classes, or not make the work. Also they need to make the work of the all classes because that importan, and all classes they need for graduate. This can be give them problems if they not make anything for they grades going up because if they have bad grades they can not graduate in three years. Clearly the students forget the importan that all classes are for graduate.

The students not take a break on summer because they want to going the summer school for make more classes. For example, they make this for graduate more early but, they do not have time for they family or for the work. Many time they need to work on summer and this affect most students, they going the school in the morning and the night they work. some families going anothers countries for vacation and the students can not going for the reason that they need to stick for study. Clearly going on summer school affect students but, this can be help for advance classes.

In conclution some school help students to graduate more early like in three years. The students can be tired because they want to make the more importans classes, but this is more hard. They bring more focus in the importants classes and the others classes not. Most of them need to going on summer school because they need to pass the classes. For all students the graduate is it importans, but everyone need to take the time in the school an have good grades when they are ready to graduate this is more importan. ",0
"Phones & Driving

Now in days, many people know how to use a cell phone and even own a cell phone. Many people tend to use their cell phone while driving and many states have placed in a law that has prohibited cell phone use while operating a vehicle. Yet regardless of the law, many still question if this law should be in place.

I feel that people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while behind the wheel because it's dangerous overall. Studies have shown that more than 3,000 people have been killed and 416,000 have been seriously injured because of a distracted driver. It has also been proven that cell phones distract a person by 37% while driving, meaning that you aren't as focused on driving and you are more likely to be holding a device with one hand. This limits the maneuverability of your other hand while driving. In 2006 a study was released by the university of utah which said the drivers that use their phones while driving are as dangerous as drunk drivers.

Many states have made a law that bans phone use while driving due to the increased danger. For example, in georgia it's prohibited to even hold a phone while driving. If caught, you could be given a primary offense. But then again, it depends by state and in fact, your insurance can go up if you get a ticket. It ranges from 4 to 30%. Many states like Florida, Tennessee, and 19 other states have a similar law in place. Currently, cell phone tickets don't go down as a dmv point but that might change on January 2021.

There are many stories of horrible accident that happened while using a cell phone and driving. For example, in minnesota a 17 year-old killed a 10 year-old and her father when she ran a red light because she was texting. She is expected to serve 4 years of probation and over 200 hours of community hours. In kansas state university, a 19 year-old died because of a one letter text. And now her older sister educates teenagers on the risks and dangers of texting and driving. In reality, these drivers aren't just putting their life in danger but they are putting others in danger too.

With all this information, I stick with my decision that people shouldn't be able to use their phone and drive. It's just a very dangerous decision. And even though there's a law in place to help improve this problem, people still tend to ignore it. They're putting everyone, including themselves, in danger. Innocent people shouldn't be in danger and it's not just grown ups but little children. Nobody should be in danger over something that can wait. I feel like people should just follow the law because it's only for their safety and everyone else'",0
"Should we learn more about the planet Venus? NASA people are studying about Veus. This article named ""The challenge of exploring venus"" tells more about the planet Venus. Learning about the planet would increase our knowledge.

Venus is an interisting planet that could effect the world around us. Paragraph 1 says,""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"", is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky.""This shows how this article is giving us background information about Venus. Venus is an important planet. This planet is not only important,also this planet is important to the people that works for NASA.

NASA, astronomers, scientist, and other people has the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. This would cause thye increase of using technology and changing the future. Paragraph 7 says,""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface."" This means that the electronics were being tested for the study of Venus. Paragraph 7 also says,""Modern computers are enormously powerful,flexible, and quick.""This article tells us how these electronics would be needed to study Venus and how it could be in dangers.

Others may say that there is no point on studying Venus,but studying Venus is a way to change our future. Paragraph 6 says,""peering at Venus form a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground."" This means that this studying could be safe depending on the conditions. Paragraph 6 also says,""Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This means that it is worthy to pursuit Venus no matter the causes.

Our knowledge of our planet should not value our worth on making studies on Venus. There is way more into Venus that could make us change our future. NASA could maintain changes for a better place on our planet and Venus.",0
"Phones and driving

Cell phones are essential tools in society that humans use to perform day-to-day operations such as communicating with others, checking the weather, and researching random topics on the Internet, however there is a time and a place for everything and cell phones should not be used by drivers in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle. Cell phones are helpful in many different forms, however they also distract you from what is in front of you. To use a cell phone you need to look at it which diverts your attention from what is physically happening around you. It is dangerous to not pay attention to what is happening around you when you were driving because it puts you and others at risk for danger. If a driver is not allowed to use their phone while operating a vehicle, then you eliminate the possibility of a car accident caused by the distraction of a cellular device.

Cons of a having a cell phone in a car

When driving, you need to pay attention to the road in order to get from your starting destination to your final destination safely. You can put yourself in harm's way when you are not paying attention to what you are doing. When using a cell phone in a car you are worried about what is happening on your phone and not worrying about what is happening in the world. You then have to switch back-and-forth really quickly to know what is going on in the road and what is happening on your phone. You can cause a major car accident which can result in the loss of life and you will become a murderer by law if you were distracted while driving. Drivers who cause accidents due to them being distracted by their cellular devices, are liable to those who were negatively affected in the accident and can be fine for using their cell phones in many different state. This reinforces the dangers that using a cell phone while driving hats.

Laws for distracted driving. In order to prevent car accidents, Government officials have put laws in place to lower the use of cellular devices while driving. Government officials have concluded that many distractions do exist while driving however cellular devices are one of the major distractions that cause the most accidents across many different states. Officials have tried to come back to this distraction by making cards with hands-free technology built into the dashboards and states have made laws prohibiting cell phone use while driving. To lower car accident rates Even further, employers put pants on the use of both hands free devices and cellular devices. Ever since state and employees have placed restrictions on cell phone use while driving, statistic show that car accidents have been on a decrease every single year.

The confident driver. A lot of drivers will argue that since they have been driving for X amount of time or because they perform so well on their drivers test, then they should be able to use their cell phones because they do not believe that they will cause any accidents. The science says differently. Science says there are many distractions on the road well a person is driving. People cause these accidents have been driving for various different amounts of years. Some of these drivers have been driving for 10+ years and others a few months. Win drivers who are using their phones at the time of the accident report there side of the story they always say that they did not see the other persons in some way, shape, form, or fashion. That is because the average reaction time of a distracted driver is 1.5 seconds. Accident reconstruction specialist also found that the average driver reaction Breaktime was to be 2.3 seconds. And with most driving accidents, a person has between about 0.7 to three seconds to react in avoid crashing. This reaction time of a human being is greatly slow with the distraction of a cell phone which leads virtually no time for the distracted driver to correct themselves.

Driving with phones

Driving with the phone is very dangerous to do. Cellular devices can and will cause drivers to divert their attention from the things surrounding them. Studies show that using cellular devices while driving increases the amount of car accidents. Using a cell phone while driving will slow down your reaction time when you are put in danger while on the road. In many different states, using your phone while driving is illegal. This is why drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

"When I was in the fifth grader I went to the camp over summer the first day they made us do a project with a group to earn the title of the best group. The benefits of working in the group or working alone. Working in the group is more beneficial rather than working alone to work in the group is fun, makes me be more responsible and it is also the easier and creative way of finding solutions for the problem.

First of all, working in the group is fun. For example, I have a friend who didn't like to work with anyone or even talk in his classroom,,, one day his teacher put him with group of students after working with them he finally made a new friends and the work that teacher was giving them was much more enjoyable with mates. For that reason I think this is a great way of learning, communicating and building friendship with people around us.

Also group work makes us more responsible. I have friend his name is Generic_Name and I want to tell you something about him he is the most irresponsible student I have ever seen, but when it comes to a group work he is getting his job always done because he doesn't want his group lose the competition or simply fail the project. This made my vision clear that working with others makes people more responsible.

Some say working with a group distracts them from the task, but I will disagree with them because I believe, that working in the group helps you find the creative way of solving the problems. In my computer science class we usually work with groups so there is this guy that thinks he knows more than some of us and for that reason he didn't work with us, so we solved the problem the way that no one in our class has solved the problem this way and the teacher gave us extra points for being the creative group of the class, and the smart guy that I mentioned before couldn't solve that problem. This is way I don't like to underestimate my teammates or classmates I know that together we can be smarter, faster, and even

If the problem seems unsolvable together we can do it.

In conclusion, working with a group is enjoyable, make you fulfill your obligations, and makes it easy for students to solve any kind of tasks. Finally, students are not going to be stressed about the problem and will complete the task with higher quality.",0
"""Mom im going to go outside to get some fresh air"" FREEZE! Wait one minute , the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean.

Its polluted.

But check this out people want car usage to end completely , i know you might think limiting car usage is the worst idea you ever heard . Just to stop pollution ? Yes .But if you think about it no cars equal no bad air.

China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission.

But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct.

Another reason why less car usages could be a good thing , it prevent being stuck in traffic & reduce alot of car accidents. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that ""Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution"" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem.

""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer & a mother of two . She walks verdant streets & love listening to her surrounding.

But oh my god in Paris if you get caught driving you will suffer a 22 to 31 dollar fine, Leave the car at home please. Since this no car usage thing started colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work & school. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The sidewalks have been replaced in Bogota by broad so it could be smooth and easier to ride on.

President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.",0
"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article source 2 ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article source 3 by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article source 3 by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida high number due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College.",0
"Cars have helped people over the years, but has it helped the environment or your heath. When driving a car, the car releases gases that can effect the air around us. There are advantages of limiting the use of cars, like a heathier environment and a heathier body.

One advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier environment. When you are driving a car the gas in the car, is let out into the air. The gas that goes in the air can effect the air and plants around us, as it can turn to toxic. As the source Elisabeth Rosenthal explains, 50 percent of the greenhouse gases are caused by carintensive areas in the United States. The gas from are cars are not just effecting are air, there effecting are greenhouse to. The source Robert Duffer tells us, how paris banded using cars after days of nearrecord pollution to clear the air. After days of no cars the air was clear again. As you can tell, limiting car uses will help the environment lot.

furthermore, Another advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier body. Instead of just siting in a car you can ride a bike,walk or roller skate. Also all those gases from the car wont be going in your body, effecting your insides. As the source Andrew Selsky explains, in Colombia on free car day the people hicked,skated and bicked to get where they need to go, instead of using a car. Without a car to take you places you will get exercie, which will give you power and engery for your body. A normal person should also exercise for 30 mintes a day. Also as Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us without a car you have less stress and are able to relax more. Cars can cause people lot of stress, and a lot of stress is not good for your body. Limiting the use of cars has a great effect on your heath.

Conslusion, Limiting the use of cars will have the advantages of a heathier environment and a heathier body. The environment and your body is a big thing in your life, so you would want to do whatever possible to keep it heathy. So instead of talking the car try to walk or ride a bike next time.",0
"I think people should stop relying on their cars so much for three reasons. I hope this can change peoples minds about using the vehicles for everything. Even going to the corner of their block just for a bite they use their cars.

The opening reason why I think people should really limit their car usage is that it causes less pollution in the atmosphere. If drives don't give a limit to their uses of their cars we might end up having global warming. That's not gonna be great. For example before when cars were rarely seen we had no global warming problem, but now that cars are seen all over the places, global warming is near of arrival.

The following reason why I think people should put a limit to their car usage is that it would benefit everyone because there will be less traffic. Having no traffic at all is a common dream for many drivers that drive to work using the expressway every morning. unfortunately people have to be stuck in traffic everyday because they don't want to let go of their cars. They should experiment other ways to get to work or to even the corner of their block. They should try bike riding to their destations. That's double the benefit. They get to exercise their bodies and not damage the environment with deadly gases that can cause global warming. In the second source by Robert Duffer he states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"".

My next reason why I think drivers should limit their car uses is because they are basically killing themselves with fatal accidents almost everyday. There's a lot of causes for fatal accidents, one of them is texting and driving. That's the main cause of fatal car accidents. Drunk driving is at close second. None the less, if people would just pay attention while they are driving there would be less car accidents, or even better they stop using their cars as often to avoid car accidents. Even when knowone is distracted while driving there are still a few car accidents. Most of the time that's just a regular accident with knowone losing their lives, but it happens many tims because the streets are so compacted with drivers eager to move. That's why I think people should stop relying on their cars so heavily. To decrease the death rate to a normal level.

In conclusion, all these three reasons why I think people should limit the usage of their vehicles are the reasons why the world isn't at it's normal levels of natural events in traffic. If citizens would rely less on their vehicles, we would see a change in the air we breathe and less chances of having global warming, less traffic in city streets, and less fatal car accidents with less people being killed.",0
"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself i'm graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool don't really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we won't even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we should'nt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didn't offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he can't do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and it's totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i should'nt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they did'nt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they should'nt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop. I'm very happy to say that i'm class of 2020!! instead of 2021, And i'm very happy that i took that road.",0
"Dear state senator, The electoral college is an unfair and irrational, and should be abolished immediately. The fact that the race for president can end in a tie is completely absurd. Also the fact that popular vote can mean basically nothing is dumbfoundidng. In a country of democracy popular vote seems like a it would be standard. popular vote seems like the best idea when it comes to a country for the people.

The electoral college is highly unfair to voters. Presidential candidates dont even have to visit all of the states to win the elections. The representation that the smaller states get is unfair. Presidential candidates will only visit states with a high number electoral college representatives because the states are known as ""swing states"". Swing states greatly influence the outcome of the election because they can hold the most power. If a state such as texas with 34 electoral votes was to have the same amount of power as a state with a much smaller population than the electoral college would seem much more viable.

The electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with that states popular vote. Al Gore, in the 2000 presidential election, won the popular vote but still lost the electionPlumer 9. The fact that a candidate can win the vote of the people but still lose the election is horrifying. How can you trust a system that works against what the United States of America is about. It completely takes away the right of people to decide what goes on in there government. The fact that the electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with people is highly unfair.

There is one crucial flaw in the electoral college, the election can end in a tie. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if just 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other wayPlumer 12. If we were to switch to a system were all states including the District of Columbia get one vote then the election could never end in a tie. Although this still seems highly unfair to the voters because the representative could go either with or against the popular vote the election could still never end in a tie solving the amjor flaw. What was to happen if we did have a tie? It has not yet been desided because it never has happened and that is a major problem.

The electoral college is highly unfair and should be disposed of immediately. The electoral college is biased towards the larger states,has major flaws that can only be fixed by getting rid of the system and does not give a fair view of what the people want. The system was poorly thought out and needs to be replaced.

sincerely, Jordan P.",0
"You can tell that the author has a sweet spot for our neighboring planet, Venus. He starts off the paper by stating some facts about Venus and how it's super close to us at times and that Venus and Earth share some traits such as their size and rocky surface. He then goes on and states that we have done our fair share of exploring in Venus, but that it just wasn't good enough because the robots don't last very long in Venus due to its hard conditions such as their acid rain, extremely warm temperature and their atmospheric pressure. After all this though NASA still wants and is finding a way to get back over at Venus and the author does a very good job at describing their plans.

NASA is thinkning about creating a robot that could take on the pressure and last a good 3 weeks but the catch is that it will have to be over the skies of Venus, just like how jet pilets go above storms to get to places. This is a good idea to an extend though. If we really wanna see what Venus truely has to offer we need to explore it at its roots, descibes the author, and I can't help but agree with him. Sure we can learn from robots but it's better to get a hand on view of things, but with Venus conditions it seems like sending humans over might not be such a good idea. The author knows this too but he doesn't seem to quit because in pragraph 8 he says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

Just from hearing that makes me agree with him and a good example I thought of is like riding a bike. It's scary the first time you ride one and you are 99% granted that you are going to fall down but does that stop you from riding it? Of course it doesn't, you get back on until it gets to the point where you don't have to think about doing it, you just do it. Yes I understand that it's more complex then that but I agree with the author by us not beling limit because of fear and danger, we could and will find a way to explore not just Venus but also the other planets in our solar system and possibly, even farther.",0
"The electoral college has been a part of the united states for many years. The founding fathers were the ones who established it in the constitution. The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does. If you are reading this senator of state I hope this letter will support your opinion on this or make you consider popular vote.

The united states is a democracy so the citizens living here should have the right to vote for the president of the united states. With the electoral college the citizens are'nt the ones voting for the president the electors are. In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the opposing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives.

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in all the states, because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only focus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisements all over the country.

Even though the popular vote is a good way to go I think that this system of electing president is still not perfect or will never be perfect. The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and should be used in future elections. If you have read this senator I hope this might have changed or supported your opinion on this topic.",0
"Throughout time, humans have sent numerous missions for astronauts or spacecraft to go into space and gather information on either the moon or our neighboring planets. Unfortunately, spacecraft has been destroyed within hours when landing on one of Earths neighboring planets, Venus. Venus is a desired place for us to be able to land on in the future or get really close to to study. Even though Venus pursuits some dangers, it is a worthy pursuit in the future because of its Earth-like structure, how close it is to earth, and the capability we have of getting up close and studying Venus.

As the author said, Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin. That is because Venus is closer than all the other planets to Earth in density and size and is sometimes the closest to Earth when the rotations of the planets meet up next to each other. A long time ago Venus was pretty much another planet Earth because it most likely had oceans and could support life forms and it had some of the same features that earth has like mountains, valleys, and craters. Scientists would love to be able to study the atmosphere of Venus and would want to know what happened to the oceans. They would also want to know the similarities and differences it has to the features of Earth.

Another reason the author says that we should pursuit studying Venus is how much closer it is to Earth than other planets besides Mars. We are so close sometimes that we have been able to send spacecraft over to the planet so we can investigate and see if we can find anything interesting about it. Also Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for a planetary visit which is strongly considered since the longevity of space travel.

The final reason we should look into pursuiting Venus is because of the tools, plans, and ideas we have to be able to get up close to Venus without becoming in danger. NASA has an idea where we can send humans to study Venus. The idea is we would have a blimp-like vehicle hovering above Venus from a very fat distance where everyone will be safe. The only setback of this idea is their is only limited sight through Venuses foggy, dense atmosphere so scientists might not be able to get clear pictures. Also their is no way of getting down close to the actual surface so no rock samples or gas samples can be taken. NASA is doing tests using silicon carbide and putting it through the same situation it would be in if it where on the surface of Venus. Another test is using mechanical computers which are used by levers and gears and are resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Even though a trip to Venus sounds impossible, NASA and other departments are figuring out how to get through some of the dangers it presents to us. If we are able to discover and study Venus, it will lead to further studies about maybe different planets and we'll be able to study it's structure and we will make new discoveries.",0
"Although it seems that the main reason for trying to explore and study Venus is just to learn more about the planet, however the author does have another reason. They believe that exploring Venus will allow the human race to conduct more dangerous missions. The author mentions several improvement to our technology and methods of exploration that are proving to be more usefull in trying to learn more about Venus.

Firstly, the author mentions that Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, however, it is more dangerous. In Paragraph 3, it is mentioned that the planet's surface temperature can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmosphere is almost completely made of carbon dioxide making it inhabiltal. Yet, the author mentions several ways that NASA is trying to overcome these obstacles. To begin with, in Paragraph 5, it is mention that NASA believes that a possible solution could be creating a vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface. This vehicle would allow astronauts to remain near Venus without having to stay on the planet's dangerous surface. However this idea won't actually help astronauts study Venus, since the dense atmosphere won't allow any visible sign of the surface without getting closer. Although unable to help astronauts to actually explore Venus, this vehicle can be used as a type of station or base near Venus to collect research or as shelter to the astronauts. This vehicle could be used on different planets as well; eventually, there could be a base on any planet that is too dangerous for mankind. This could be one of the many possible ways to improve our abilities for future space travel. Improvements like these are why the author believes that the human race should continue to try to study Venus.

More important changes for space exploration are the improvements in out technology.

In Paragraph 6 it is mentioned that our current forms of taking pictures and videos can't be used unless close to the ground; however, the materials for these devices would melt if they're too close to the surface. For planets similar to Venus, with hazardes surfaces and inmense heat, a possible solution can be using old technology. Looking back at the article, in Paragraph 7 some simplified devices last longer in conditions resembling Venus. Another use of simplier and older technology can be the use of mechanical computers to send and collect information. Since these computers don't require electronics to work they can be built of stronger materials that can overcome all the challenges found on Venus. Like mentioned in the previous paragraph, these new changes are why the author believes that mankind should keep trying to explore Venus because it will all help in future explorations to similarly dangerous planets.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea that studying Venus is worth persuing despite the dangers because it can help in trying to explore similar planets. The advances that are made in trying to explore Venus can change the future of space travel in ways never seen before. These new explorations can lead the human race to explore the entire galaxy and maybe find life within the stars.",0
"In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people dont know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth's environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we dont really need cars to live our everyday lives.

Limiting car usage in your community is good beacuse it prevents traffic. Everyday, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic some times. For example, in Paris there has been days of near-record pollutions due to traffic so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set.

Another reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the air around you. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the community around you. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These ""car Free"" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a garge in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution.

We should limit how often we use cars because we dont really need them to get around and many countries beleive so too. For example in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because any one who violated this rule would have been fined $25 but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries environment. The turn out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn't stop them. The mayor of Bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event.

There are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic , helps the environment and because we dont really need to use cars so often , take Colombia for example. So lets take action and follow the steps that many countires and communities are taking to help our communities.",0
"Is the Electoral College fair or not, thats is was many people are trying to figure out. The Electoral College is a process of votes that allows people to choose a president, but some contries get to vote and some dont even see a campaign ad. I believe the Electoral College is not a fair process because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president, also the winner-takes-all system doesn't rely on the states that have no chance of winning but relies on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

There are many things wrong with the Electoral College that can ruin the vote system for a long time. According to Source 2, under the Electoral College the voters dont even get to vote for the candidate they want, but have to vote to a slate of electors which is unfair. Voters sometimes cannot contol who they vote for so voters sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. It depends on the state to pick the slate of electors on state conventions, or even by presidential candidates themselves.

The winner-takes-all syestem can be very unfair to some states who want to vote for a candidate. The winner-takes-all system is unfair because the candidates dont spend time on those states that have no chance of winning, but relies on the states that can win. 17 states including  Rhode Island and North Carolina dont even get to see the candidate because they are states that have no chance of winning. Also 25 large media markets dont even get to see a campaign ad because the candidates dont bother to but one up. The fate of the presidency is in the hands of a few voters in ohio which is just unfair to other states.

I believe that the Electoral College is unfair because they have done many wrong things that can effect other states and the vote system for a very long time.",0
"Do you think The Face on Mars is natural? As a scientist at NASA I sure do! I think it is natural because we (NASA) released the pictures within a few days of taking them. Also, the pictures would show any alien markings. Finally, the story says that there are some of those formations on earth. I truly believe that it is a natural formation.

We, NASA, released pictures of The Face on Mars just a few days after we took them. Would we do that if we believed it was evidence of alien activity? Would we want to show that to the public, I don't think so! If we believed that it was alien related we wouldn't show the public and get them riled up. It would be nonsensical. I highly doubt that we would show the public if it was aliens.

Don't you think our top of the line cameras would show any alien markings? In the passage it even says each pixel from our camera is only 1.56 meters! That is a very large zooming ability! Our cameras are very expensive, and are top of the line. We use those cameras for the reason of seeing very small details like markings and any other little things. I really think our cameras would have picked up any alien markings, if there was any!

Finally, there are land formations like that on our own planet, earth! There are what we call mesas found all over the American West, which is the same things as the formation on mars. The mesas are formed from a lava dome. Also we know that something like that can happen on mars just like it can on earth. I think the landform is a mesa just like we have on earth.

Is The Face on Mars natural? I think so! I think that because NASA would not release pictures like that if they thought it was alien related! Also our top of the line cameras would have shown any little alien markings if there was any. Lastly, there are mesas on earth as well! I believe that The Face on Mars is a natural land formation, don't you?",0
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes the new facial recognision technology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS). This system claims to read emotion expressions. I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship and think it is a valuble thing in classrooms.

Some possitive thing about the new technology are adaptation and improvment. With this new technology we can use it to adapt different things like ads and school lessons. Ads can sometimes completely take out the interest on the viewers for the video and can be sometimes unpridictable. This has happend numerous times in classrooms when a teacher wants to show a documentary that is all ready slighty borring and an ad showing an exciting new superheroes movie comes up So now you have the entire class talking about it and not paying any atention to the documentary about Charles Darwin and what he did. Having these distracting ads adapt to what the audience is feeling could help bring down the amount of times this happens. The FACS could also help in computer lesson planing. If the FACS would be installed in a computer the computer would be able to realise that a student is no longer paying attencion becouse of boredom. So system can then improve what the lesson has by chnging the order around to give the student a more personalised lesson thus having the student learn easier.

There are some bad feedback as well. If the FACS system succeds in improving the academic scores of the students the school administration might deside that the teacher are no longer needed to teach the student, the students could just study in there cmputers. Another way the FACS could not be so good is that it is likely to be very expencive and there is ways a possibility it can malfunction and give unwanted changes in lessons and other sections in which it would be used.

In conclusion I think that the FACS could be of great help in the world if it could be 100% reliable. This system could benifit the every day use if used corectly and I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship. I think it is a valuble thing in classrooms.",0
"Distracted Dangerous Driver

American teens shouldn't have the privilege of using their phone while driving. The most leading cause of death for American teens is texting and driving crashes. 21% of teens were killed in car accidents because they were distracted by their cell phone. Americans are beginning to believe the fatalities are from distractions from digital devices and undeveloped brains in their teen state.

For instance, the average student checks their phone every 8.6 minutes. This is especially dangerous because when they're leaving school, their instinct is to scrutinize their messages as they're driving.

There are already people on the road who can't drive well, so by decreasing phone access to all, not just teen, we can minimize car accidents. Because of teens undeveloped brains, they are not likely to think of the dangers around them.

Therefore, ""research evidence reveals for example that a sixteen-year-old brain is not completely developed it fully developed at the age of 25."" The evidence from the passage shows how early we are able to drive at such an immature state of mine. The passage also states, ""When teens are speeding, brain researchers maintain, their brains thrill center is working perfectly but the part of your brain that weighs risk is not yet fully developed.""

This evidence shows, teenagers at the age of 16 are being very careless on the road then being careful. Teenagers being careless on the road causes many fatalities of teens, which flows right into the next topic.

In Conclusion, proceeding more precautions can also decrease teen deaths. In this topic it really all comes down to how the lawmakers want to pursue this problem. That being said the USA must figure out a way to fix this major problem with teens being addicted to their phones.

"In this essay I will be talking about the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" The face was not created by aliens it is a natural landform. I have a lot of evidence for my claim.

They all prove that it is a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

It was not created by aliens.

Here is some evidence. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" Another piece of evidence is it was describes as a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

Last but not least I have one more piece of evidence ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" They thought is was made by aliens because they usually don't see this face. Now that they know it is a natural landform they will always see it.

In conclusion we can prove that the Face in Mars is just a natural landform.

At the beginning everyone thought that aliens made this. ""It has been shown in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" All of this evidence proves that it was just a natural landform no one ever noticed.",0
"All scientists at NASA know that the ""The Face"" is a natural landform known as a mesa. But some people think that Nasa is lying to the public about it being a natural landform. I'm here today to argue that Nasa is indeed not lying.

My first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying is that a drone was up in space taking pictures of it close enough to show the world tha it was just a natural landform. Viking 1 is the name of the spacecraft that took this photo and some mission controllers were suprised to see a face popu up on their screen. The chief scientist for NASA'S Mars exploration program said ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it .""

They also got more icture to deduce that it was actually instead of a face it was a natural landform. Thats my first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying.

My second reason for knowing NASA is not lying is because the landform is called a mesa. Mesa's are more commonly found in the American West. So by thinking hardly about this it comes to mind could people that dont believe, could possibly being saying that this mesa isnt a mesa but something NASA is trying to cover up? But then the question comes to be WHY would Nasa be trying to hide some of this information from the public? Well it comes down to the simple fact they arent trying to hide anything from the public about the face they are giving us the true information and some people just dont thig thats the real actual truth.

My thrid reason for knowing that Nasa is not lying they made the pictures into digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so if anything was on the surface such as a shack you could tell what it was. They do that so if they see anything that is a undertiminable object you can clerly tell what it is. The pixels arent as good as they could be today but they had a pretty lea view of what it is. they have the best cutting edge technology and are way more advanced than the open world is today so its highly unlikely that their system wasnt processing right. thats the end of my thrid reason.

So some people believe that the face is actually just a natural landform but some people such as conspiracy theorists dont. I say that the conspiracy theorists have a point on why Nasa could be lying to the public. They probably think this because of the goverment owning and controls Nasa that Nasa is lying to us like the goverment could be because of their secret projects. The reason the goverment doesnt tell s about some of their plans is because its to keep the United States of America safe from the har of foreign countries. Those were the reasons conspiracy theorists think like they do.

All that information can signify that Nasa is not lying to us. Though some people may think they are because they are apart of the goverment .But i think that Nasa is doing a great job and woudnt lie to the press. If they lied to the press they would be utting the U.S goverment a bad public view.",0
"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governments, and are acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advantages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Cars are defined as a motor veshel that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas. acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pollution into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hospital because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pollution. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution said carlos arturo plaza.

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often. it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in hisher house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.

in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.",0
"Many people feel the need to check their cellular device while behind the wheel of a vehicle. Although many people own and operate cellphones on a daily basis, they shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle because it is a hazard for everyone. To begin with, it causes a distraction to those driving and others who are also on the road. If any lights come on for notifications, others may stray their eyes to see what is flashing in their mirrors or next to them which could cause an accident to occur on the roadway. Everyone needs to stay focused on where they're driving so no mishaps occur. Even if there is a stop in traffic, people need to be wary of their surroundings since it could start moving at any time. Everyone nowadays is curious about their phones, almost everyone always has a cellular device on them which causes a ""need"" to be pay so much attention to their pockets. Although many may want to have their phones on hand, it isn't a necessity for anyone. Additionally, most people should stay off their phones because it is a hazardous situation in general. For example, people tend to crash into others when they are too attentive to their cellular device. If one is not careful, an accident on the road is waiting to occur and it could be just around the corner. Although plenty of people may say that it is important to check for work or some other related or unrelated topic, the other person should understand that it would be illegal and unsafe to check the phone while driving. In conclusion, it is unnecessary for people to check their cellular devices while driving because it is not very safe and could cause accidents on the road.",0
"Dear Senator of Florida, I think changing the election by popular vote for the President of the United States would be a better and and more fair way of voting. The Electoral College may work and all but even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the President."" Voting gives people rights and freedom that not everybody has. If a voter wanted to vote for a President their vote should go towards the President, not the electors of the state, in all fairness. According to Plumer many people agree with the idea of changing the voting system by stating, ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" In plumber's article he says, the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" By putting this statement in his article he is trying to say that the system we have now could all go up in flames if the right thing happened to get rid of the Electoral College, so Americans should watch out. The Electoral College is unfair due to the winnertakeall system. In this system candidates for the presidency don't go to smaller states because they know they won't win with those states. They stick to the big states with more electoral votes or with the ""swing"" states. That's what I call selfish.

I understand that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" If the next President were to win the electoral vote but not the popular vote that is like saying that only the Electoral College voted and not the real voters, the people.

All in all ""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" I would greatly appreciate if you read this over and thought about the topic I have addressed to you. Thank you for your consideration.",0
"The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have seperated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the descision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their descision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote. z",0
"The face on Mars is just a natural landform. I think this because the face reminds someone of middle butte in the snake river plain of Idaho.

Just becuase the face is in movies and magazines do not make it true their is lots of story in magzines that is not true.

If this was a face,The face would have been gone after 25 years later. The picture may look like a face but its just a landform.

I think the face is just a landform bacause the picture is actually showing is a mesa lanform that can be mistaken by a face.

The face on mars can be related to some things on earth like the middle of the butte in the snake river plain of Idaho.

When someone had made the picture larger the face just looked more and more like a mesa or a butte landform. Micheal malin went to take more pictures which was more clear and he found out that it is just a natural landorm.

I'm not the only one who believes that the face on mars is just a lanform. a scientist want more proof of this so went to take more pictures and he found out the true about this face. For the people who believes the face is real just go to JPL web site, you can find better picture of it and you will see what I'm see. Which is just a landform mistaken for an alien face.

These are some reason why you should believe me when i said the face is just a landform nothing else not and alien face or an human face. I understand why someone would think this is a alien face because the first picture was not so clear and it did look like a face.

But now there is a better picture on this web site thats show nothing but a landform.",0
"In the article ""The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author uses a few reasons to support his argument, but he tends to dwell on the challanges of going to Venus and not the rewards.

First, his first and body paragraph focuses on how it is hard to get the right timing to go to Venus, and how all of our unmaned missions have not made it or not survived more than a few hours. He ends paragraph 2 by saying that it is hard to get the right timing to go to Venus and we have not had a spaceship touch down in more than three years. This is not a good way to start his article becasue it leaves the reader wondering why we would even bother going to Venus. The author makes it sound very challenging from the start and does not leave the reader with much hope for the journey to Venus.

In paragraph 3 the author describes the deadly charectaristics of Venus. He talks about how the planets surface is 800 degrees Farenheit and how the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than are own planet. Then the author gives examples on what those conditons can do such and melting metals and crushing submarines. Once again the author dwells on the challanges of going to Venus and not the rewards. Between the first and second paragraph the author does not build a compelling argument to go the Venus.

In paragraph 4 the author starts to build his argument for going to Venus. He states that it is the most earth-like planet, and it has a surface of rocky sediment that has planetary fetures close to ours. Other than that he does not build a case for Venus that a lot of people would back up. His argument that it si the closest planet in case we ever needed to leave earth is an invalid argument becasue of the state of our tech compared to the extreemley harsh conditions of Venus.

In paragraph 6 the author describes ways that we have tried to research Venuns that haven't worked. In paragraph 7 the author describes possible tech made by NASA that could solve some of the issues Venus poses, but that tech is simply not ready yet. This of the essay starts to make going to Venus sound more feasable, but the technology he is describing is not ready yet.

In the article ""The Challange of Exploring Venus"" the author tries to make an argument for going to Venus. He explains all the challanges and then tries to justify them by the payoff being to settle human curiosity. The article is well written he just makes more of a case for not going to Venus. Maybe in 50 years the technology will be in a good place to go to Venus, but as of right now it seems too challenging.",0
"The problem with the electoral college is that the people really arent controlling who they vote for. Personally i am in favor of changin the electoral college to popular vote. The representatives of the electoral college can basically vote for who ever they want to vote for. The people only influence the electoral college. The people should have the right to vote for the candidate that they want not the one that some representative in the electoral college chooses. These are just some reasons why i think the presidential should be replaced by popular vote.

To begin with, the representatives of the electoral college can basically vote for who ever they want to vote for. When a voter places there vote they arent voting for the actual president they are simply voting for the reps of the electoral college. ""The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" What this means is that basically the election is based on what they decide not on what the people say.

Furthermore, the only thing the people do by voting is that they influence the electoral college's decision. The people dont really get to choose who they believe should be in office. All the electoral college does is get in the way of whom the people choose to be president. The electoral college should be removed and replaced with popular vote. This should take place as soon as possible.

Lastly, the people should have the right to vote for whom they believe should take office; not for some representative that is gonna choose who ever they want. For example, lets say that one votes for obama, they arent really voting for obama they are voting for someone who could pick obama, But the person that they vote for to pick obama could change there mind and vote for the other candidate. So really the peoples vote doesnt even matter. All it does is influence the vote of some representative from the electoral college. I believe that this should be changed to popular vote. In which the people vote for the candidate they want to be president and then all the votes are counted up and compared. Thats the way the presidential should be done. This is the best way for the peoples voice to be recognized and it will make a difference.",0
"To begin with, I think we should keep Electoral Colleges because there are many benefits. A Electoral College is a process not a place in wich the founding fathers established to compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and eleciton of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Some of the many benefits are a voiding run-off elections, it helps citizens votes be more meaningfull.

For starters, Electoral Colleges help avoid run-off elections. The benefit of having it avoid run-off elections is, that when there is a run-off election and when no canidates win a majority of the votes cast; the pressure is greatly reduced because of the electoral colleges. As a example, as a example you only have 43 percent majority of the popluarity votes. If more votes in the college is elected to one president than the other the president is alot more likely to win.

In addition, another reason on why we should keep Electoral Colleges are because it helps citizens votes seem more meaningfull. How a Electoral College does this is by, making you vote more powerful. If we didnt have these colleges democrats in Texas, and Republicans in California would know there vote wouldnt mean anything therefore they would not pay much attention to the election than if they knew the president was picked by populat votes. That is why in 2012 only half of the eligable voters voted because they knew that there vote would not make a difference.

In conclusion, that is why i think we should keep our Electoral Colleges, because is helps by avoiding run-off elections, and it helps citizens votes more meaningfull and has more power to know that popularity votes now count because of the Electoral Colleges and more elegible can now vote with confidence.",0
"Someone will find many activity enjoyable such as soccer. I think people should play many sport like soccer

People will find soccer fun because you get to work together and they just have fun. For example people now in days don't even talk anymore they text. If you play together you can communicate with others. Working together with other people would be good for the future because you will know how to get along with others even if you kinda don't like them you will learn how to be patient. When you play soccer you get to hang out with your friends and possibly meet new people that you might actually might like . So you get to make new friends by just playing soccer. In life it's not about winning it's about having fun with your friends. Mostly playing soccer can be fun other people you might not even know so you get to work as a team and having more then one person play with you. If you go outside to play soccer you get to run and thats good for your health so you get to have fun and be healthy instead of sitting at home getting sick by eating unhealthy. You can grow up to be strong,healthy,nice,athletic,ect...Soccer is a very fun sport that mostly everyone loves some people dont really like it thats why i am writing this to pursued people to play. This is why i think people are going to enjoy playing soccer and talk to their friends saying that soccer is enjoyable..          ",0
"Limiting Car Use

Many cities are now switching to become ""car free"".  The more that cities do this, we are seeing a decrease in pollution, less automobile related deaths per year, and more resources being conserved.

When cities switch to become car free, the pollution levels instantly decreasesd.  Due to the smog and the carbon monoxide emmitions in the atmosphere from cars, there is a hole in our Ozone layer in the atmosphere.  Now that people are banning cars in cities there is much more heathy air to breathe and it is much safer for our environment.  Also when there was more pollution in the air, and it rained, the rain turned in to acid rain causing erosion and killing several plants/animals.  If we could ban cars in more cities in the USA and all around the world, we would be living a much healthier lifestyle.

Also, the car free idea makes people much safer, as far as automobile accidents.  Because as the autombiles are banned from the city, the accident rate will go down more even than it already has.  Also Heidrun Walter said ""when I had a car I was alwyas tense.""  Not having a car, and not having the concern of crashing can relieve your stresses.  It is scientifically proven that when people are less stressed they get more sleep and have less angerment problems.  If cities switched to being car free, people could start living safer and happier.

Lastly, being car free, saves vital resources, and fossil fuels.  It takes millions of years to make oils, and gasses in the Earths crust, which we are wasting everyday on automobiles.  If we were able to save these resources, we could perhaps use more in rockets or space travel and maybe find another planet that can sustain our life.  If we were able to achieve this goal of saving resources, we could also all save money.  Imagine not having to pay for gas anymore.  You could be a millionare.  If we stopped using fossil fuels the world could become a much better place.

My point is, if we become car free, we could live safer, happier, and more wealthy lives.  If your community went the the mayor and state officials, it could happen for your city.  You could be the start to a revoulution and, start the journey to save humanity.  Not only would you get the bennifets of living safer, happier, and wealthier, but the whole world would be living in a much better place.  Please take this into consideration and make an effort to become ""car free"".",0
"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson's quote is accurate because we can not accomplish something without doing something in life. Everyone has a goal in life; to meet those goals we have to prepare and take steps to complete them. Some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. There is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone.

For starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. One reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. For example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. This proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. This shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing. Another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. For example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. This proves that students that accomplish more by being on task with their education will graduate with a future ahead of them. As a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education.

Second, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place. A reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. For instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. We as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. This shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. Another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life. For example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us to consider to make better food choices. As a result, there is many opportunities we can take to make this world become a better place for everyone. We can only accomplish a lot by doing everything in our power to make better this world a better place.

In Jefferson's quote, he was saying that we can do so much by doing something and it is true. If we put our mind into something and do everything we can to accomplish what we have in mind we can do anything, but if we just sit there doing nothing, we will not have the outcome we expected to want. Everyone lives in different ways, but it is important to see what each of us individuals can accomplish in life. The only way we can graduate is by focusing and staying on task. Some may see the see the world as being lazy, but we can change that by helping out and planning something together as a group to make a change in the world. It is important that we are making a change for ourselves and our communities. These are some reason why we should always do something to get the outcome that we want to see.",0
"In 1976, NASA found something pretty odd on Mars. What you may ask? They call it the Face on Mars. NASA has took new high-resolution images to study. People believe it was created by aliens, other people believe it's just a natural landform. On May 24, 2001 NASA noticed something strange. So they snapped some photos and they spotted a shadow likeness of a human face. But that is just shadows. Scientists soon figured out it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. Maybe it is just an illusion. But the Face on Mars has become a pop icon, featured in movies and books. This is likely to just be a conspriracy theory. NASA noticed that there was no ancient civilization on Mars at any time in the past. Only few scientists believed it was an alien artifact.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the firdt time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharper than the original ones. Anxious web surfers waited until the image appeared on the JPL wesite...sadly for them, it was a natural landform. No one was satisfied. Skeptics say that the alien marking were "" hidden by haze."" All these facts did'nt stop mission controllers. The mission controllers got prepared to look again. They state that they don't pass the Face often.

There is alot more ways to prove that the Face is just a landform, and not something created by aliens. NASA has done tons of research to prove it is a natural landform. NASA took years to find out what it was. It might be shaped as a face, but it was'nt created by aliens. Would'nt you think that if aliens were on Mars they would've created more things? They searched and searched but there was'nt anything odd about

Mars. So why would you be worried about a landform? So if you plan on thinking the Face on Mars was created by aliens, just ask yourself "" How?"" We all have illusions that our mind trick us about, maybe this is yours.",0
"It has been statistically documented that cellphone-related accidents are increasing at an alarming rate. The usage of phone apps, texting, GPS mapping for directions, and social media sites have caused new laws and penalties to be passed due to cellphone-related injuries and deaths. In my opinion, drivers cell phone usage should be limited while driving with the usage of features such as hands-free options which should be mandatory.

According to the National Safety Council, 2019 Texting-While-Driving Report; the average cellphone related deaths is roughly 1,600,000 accidents per year. The top two most common distractions of automobile drivers are: talking on a cell phone and sending text messages.

Nationally the state of Georgia ranks number four by Expert Market research (www. expertmarket. com) with an average of 132.7 Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones.

However, the number of accidents caused by cell phone use while driving is severely under- reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (www. nhtsa. gov/distracted-driving). The issues of cellphone related problems with Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones continue to grow when you consider the victims who have either died or experienced severe injuries by vehicle operators who have struck bystanders due to a simple message or post.

Even though the statistics cause concern advocates for public safety feel that cell phone use while driving can be lifesaving for onsite emergencies, roadside assistance, and even responding to Amber Alerts. Both sides have valid arguments that have increased major phone carriers and company's like Apple Inc. have creating phone features such as voice activated Hands-free Calling, Do Not Disturb, and Disable While Driving to help minimize the possibility of anything cell-phone related occurring,

In conclusion, I feel that in the future cell phones and automobiles including cargo trucks alone will have driver algorithm and functions that will help decrease problems with cell phone- related driver issues. I do not feel that it is necessary to completely eliminate operating a cell phone while driving in case of a emergency especially health related or to even report kidnapping & human-trafficking which is a huge problem for the state of Georgia and nationally. Drivers need to be more mindful and obey the laws or be penalized by the new laws meant to protect people.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, electoral college is a process that consists of selecting electors,meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. electoral college should not be changed to election. electoral college should be kept because it will help save the tress by saving paper, one wouldnt have to go anywhere because the electoral college is not a place,and because there are 5 different methods of choosing the president.

saving paper is extremely important. paper comes from trees and many animals and wild life have homes in trees. with electoral college one wouldnt need paper to vote, which is a paper saver. the electoral college helps a lot when it comes to selecting electors,metting of the electors and where they wil vote for the president, and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. by saving gas one is saving money which can be used for any nessessitites.

gas now a days is extremely expensive,but with the electoral college one would be saving money because the electoral college is a process, not a place, and it doesnt require one to travel anywhere,whch saves gas and money. with the oney saved one can buy the nessessities that are needed. the electoral college offers a lot by just being a process. it helps save paper and money,whch is good for wild life and humans.

when it comes to methods for choosing the presisent and reasons to keep the method there isnt just 1, theres 5! the first method is that certainty of outcome.. it states that a dispute over the outcome of an elecotral college vote is possible and it happened in 2000,but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. a winning candidats share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. for example, in the elections that happened in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, b ecause almsot all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis,ev en a very slight. method number 2 is everyone's president. the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no region(south,northeast,etc)has eneough electoral votes to elect a president. method 3 is swing states. the winner-take all method  of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election-to focus their campain efforts on the toss-up states. voters in toss-up states are more likely to poay more attention to the campain-to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are gouing to decide the election. method 4 is big states. the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population0 losy by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the consitutuion. mthod 5 is avoid run-off elections. the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

Mr. senate you should keep electoral ollege because it saves paper,saves gas and because it shows us the 5 methods that should be used for choosing the president. the electoral college offers a lot to wild life and also to humans by savikng trees and gas, which saves us humans money that one can spend on nessessities.",0
"Every vote makes a difference. Every single vote plays a role in electing a president, whether it be directly, or indirectly. The Electoral College has caused a lot of controversy with that thought. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer 14) Where are the facts behind the argument against it? We all hear people complaining and saying these things, but they have no facts as to why abolishing the Electoral College would be beneficial. The Electoral College is working in the peoples' favor and i believe we should keep it.

There are so many uneducated voters. People that vote for the presidential candidate at the top of the list because they have no clue who any of the people are anyway. If the president was selected by just popular votes who knows what the nation would be like. Every vote counts. Yes, this is true even with Electoral College it just a process to make sure that the votes being sent in are educated and well thought out; not chosen out of laziness. Do we want the people who vote just to say they voted to have a huge say in who runs our country? I sure don't. I'd rather have a trusted group of people who are very well educated take our votes into huge consideration and seal the deal. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nomonee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)..."" (Posner 16). Richard A. Posner goes on to tell us how many times the trust has been betrayed... the most recent being in the election year 2000 and then the only other time the electoral vote did not reflect the popular vote was 1888. There's no reason to change a system that isn't broken.

Obviously the system has its flaws, but nothing is perfect. Sure the Electoral College messed up twice, but that isn't some mass amount that was detrimental to our nation. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" (Office of the Federal Register 1) It's a compromise that has worked for so long; there's not enough valid reasons to change it.

The Electoral College gives the right amount of representation to different sized states. ""The Popular vote was very close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes."" (Posner 21) The majority of the state was in favor of Obams's ideas so 29 Electoral votes would work in their states favor, instead of having an almost tie vote which would make a smaller difference in the outcome. The Electoral College votes are like each states individual votes for the candidate that would make the majority of that one state happy, or that would benefit that one state. So yes, the popular vote may not always win, but the outcome of the presidential election is based on which person was the favorite of the majority of each individual state.

All in all, the Electoral College works for this nation. It worked for our founding fathers and it's still working for us, no matter what people want to argue. If ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" (Plumer 9) then the majority of our country should be able to come up with a valid argument against it.",0
"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" talks about new software created by Thomas Huag, who studies Advanced Science at the University of Amsterdam along side his colleague Dr. Huang. They are both experts at coming up with better ways for humans and computers to communicate. That is excatly what this new invention is about. The invention they created is used to help recognize not only humans emotions but paintings' emotions as well. Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting the ""Mona Lisa""

is the subject of this particular experiment. Both scientists were succesful in finding out what were her actual feelings behind her smile. This invention would also be valuable for students in a classroom.

The author writes in the six paragraph ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". The author continues to elaborate and says that then the lesson would be modified. Modifying the lesson can mean that the teacher changes their teaching plan to fit the students understanding. Having this new innovation will make students smarter and get higher test grades, because they will be learning at their own pace and level, thus helping them understand the work better.

This invention could also be essential for everyday human interactions as well since most of us communicate through a nonverbal launguage, this inventions would help us humans eachother better. Better communication leads to a lot of positivity in the world such as, less wars because we would be getting along better and understandandng eachother better.

Overall this new invention would be very essential to use in a classroom for many reasons. It helps students understand the lesson more. Understanding is key for better test grades.",0
"Can multiple advice's benefit your choice on what to do? Most people believe that multiple advice's is better than just one advice. When people ask for an advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Asking for advice to multiple friends is better than one because of the following reasons. When someone asks more than one person they all can get a different response. The person who said their advice might say why they said that about their certain response. If people only ask one person, they might say the wrong thing to do. When I ask someone for an advice, they sometimes might tell me to do a wrong thing. After, I ask my friends for advice and then when they give me the advice, later on I think on my own what is the right thing to do. I think about what everyone said and the reason why they said their responses, then make my decision on what I should do. Questioning advises to friends gets their point of view of how they might see things. Their point of view will make you think of the situation and to make a correct choice. When I ask peers for an advice, later they tell me what they would do and why they would do that so then I start to see how they are thinking. Seeing different point of views is good because I can see the good and bad things about a choice. Lastly, I have to think what is the best for me and see the best point of view to see if I might the correct decision.

Advice from best friends is better than just friends! Asking friends for an advice is better than some person that doesn't do good things. Best friends are the best choice to ask for a advice, even better than just asking regular friends! When I ask for an advice I mostly go to my best friends first, because we know each other well and tells me the right thing to do. My best friends know me so they will advice the best for me. My best friends help me make the right decision. Best friends tell you the truth about what choice to make. They even tell you the good and bad things for both sides of the answer. I trust more best friends than friends because some friends just lie to make you do the wrong thing unlike best friends help you to do the right things. Best friends even help me up if the decision I made was bad, but its not always like that for peers. Peers can help me for an advice but not like a best friend because they really do try to help me.

For these reason I believe that multiple advises are better than one. Also, best friends are the best choice to pick for an advice. More point on views is better than one.",0
"Ever since cell phones became popular in the late 1990's, in America, they have evolved from being simple mobile dialing and answering machines to basically mini computers that allow humans to now do a multitude of things like surf the internet and bank online to name a few. Unfortunately, in rent years humans have used cell phones to answer and receive calls, text and surf the Internet.

As a result, cell phones have caused automobile accidents which have unfortunately led to deaths.

In my opinion, drives should not be able to use cell phones if they are held in ones hand, however, they should be allowed to use cell phones in ""hands free"" mode as follows while operating a vehicle:

1. to talk and/or talk text via Bluetooth, 2. to use maps and/or a navigation system and 3. for entertainment purposes such as listening to music and the ability to watch movies, especially during cross county travel.

Talking and texting while driving has become a ""hot topic"" in recent years mainly because of more and more humans using cell phones on a daily basis and the rise in traffic accidents due to talking and/or texting. I will agree that drivers can get distracted while talking on the cell phone while using their hands.

I will also agree that drivers can get distracted by using their hands to text because the driver is constantly looking up and down which results in loss of concentration and attention to other drivers and to the road. However, a solution to the problem would be to mandate that all drives must use ""hands free"" mode via Bluetooth or you will be in violation of the law and can get a traffic ticket if seen using your hands.

Before the cell phone, humans used actual paper maps to navigate the world.

Until the early 2000's when cell phones came with satellite navigation via Goggle maps, software and apps such as MapQuest and Waze which allow the driver to get directions to their destinations via the cell phone.

Navigation systems usually speak to the driver via the sound system in the vehicle which allow the driver to not use their hands.

However, there are times that drivers use their hands to see the maps, therefore resulting in a traffic accidents. A solution to this issue would be to require all drivers to use the ""hands free"" mode while using navigation systems.

The Internet has allowed for cell phones to have the ability to play radio stations from all over the country and not just local radio stations.

The Internet has also allowed for humans to download their favorite music to their cell phones which they can then listen to the music via the phone.

The Internet has also given humans the ability to watch television and movies via the cell phone by using apps such as YouTube and Netflix.

Music has probably least likely to cause drivers to get distracted.

However, movies have most likely caused traffic accidents because the driver looks up and down at the screen losing concentration while driving.

A solution to this problem would be that the driver can only listen to music while driving and only the passengers can watch movies while the driver is driving, which are all ""hands free"" solutions.

In conclusion, it is my opinion that drivers should be able to use cell phones in the capacity of ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle.

The actual cell phone device is really not the issue that causes traffic accidents, it is basically the user lacking concentration, not paying attention and not using hands free mode that causes traffic accidents.

Although humans will still get into traffic accidents while using ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle, it will most certainly cut down the number of accidents in the United States and around the world.",0
"Dear state senator, After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not efficient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy. Although defying the people does not happen often there is still the risk of repeating history to a greater extent.

Continuing, the ""winner takes all system"" causes states with smaller populations to be ignored. According to source 3, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Larger states are paid the most attention to by candidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored candidate winning. Even more, candidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared candidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention. In contrast, it can be argued that no single region can shift a campaign greatly, nonetheless a single voters vote.

The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for candidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States.",0
"Hey state senator, I'm writing this letter because I want to change the elections by popular vote for the president of the United States. In the passages say ""The Electoral College process consists of selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress."" (Source 1, by Office of the Federal Register) I think the people should vote for the president they want to rule the country, also i think is unfair because people have a voice and they can choose for whoever they want. ""Under the electoral college system, voters voe not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Source 2, by Bradford Plumer) Why voting for slate electors when you can vote for the president right away, it is a wate of time. As the passage was saying ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Source 3, by Richard A. Posner) This means that Electoral College prosses is out of age and non-democratic.

Some people might think that the Electoral College is right. ""The Constitution as a compromise between electon of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" (Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Register) This shows us that the electors are better qualified than ordinary people, they know what the country needs and who is better to rule it.

Indeed, the Electoral College is unfair and a waste of time. who will know what is better of the country than the people who walks in it everyday, who has seen what is going on and who is fighting for making this country a better place for the future. ""It's official: The Elrctoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Source 2, by Bradford Plumer) That is why I think it should be abolish the electoral college.",0
"DEAR, Senator

Changing the electoral college would not be an great idea due to the fact that it has been around for centuries and would negatively impact the voting system. Some believe the voting system is a very unfair and outdated system because of the electoral college. When changing the system to popular vote it will affect many people, it may also come out worse than the electoral college. 3 big points why the electoral college should stay the same is one because the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries. The second great point is that a disaster only happend once. Then the third main point is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.

The electoral college has been around forever so why change it now. Some belive that the electoral college is a good idea Because of the voting way in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. which is good because people need to have a leader of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for whta they do. Presidents talk about what they are gonna do to help the country and the slate elelctors define what the presidents are gonna do to help out that certain state. Then the people of the state vote there slate electors for good reasons. The electoral system should stay around alot longer the system is just rigt for voting.

The electoral  college is in good shape for staying and not changing a disater only happend once 14 years ago back in 2000. That means at least  3 elections happend since then and nothing went wrong. Even though if the electoral college system is such a good system then why was there such confusion in th200 fiasco. That makes the electoral college system look very bad becuase it can keep it's voting in balance at all. This was only once, If the system changes then this could happen more than many more times. Then soon we won't even know which president wins the election.

The electoral college looks really good due to the ""winner-take-all""

system which awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. some say this is far but others believe the ""proportional representatin"" system, the system that the state governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"", which list all the canidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of there respective electors.

In overall the eletoral college should stay due to the fact that the electoral college has been around keeping voting in place for centuries, a disaster only happend once and finally is the winner take all idea is a great idea for the electoral college.  so let's not try new stuff keep the electoral college.",0
"This might be a good way to help stop school shootings. You can identify which studnet needs help and can go and talk to that student . Being able to read emotions can be helpful but it may also be distracting. For example"" the student appering unintrested and or bored and it automanically changes to a video game"" ? Some student are special needs or may be thinking about something happing at home or maybe what's for lunch ? , and the next thing they see is their work has been erased and or changed and they can do nothing about it and send them into a panick attack and can not focus on anything except trying to calm down. Im both with and against this .

We have a right to privacy unless there is a reason for worry. This could possibly assist students who have a undetected disorder or possibly prevent school shootings . We should have a personal right not to reveal are emotions if we do not want to , but i think if there is a cause for worry on certain students than maybe we could try it.",0
"Using the Facial Action Coding Sytem is a great idea to have in a classroom. When a teacher is teaching sometimes kids don't understand what they are teaching about, but if they have an asasignment on the computer and they use the system it will help a lot of teachers out. If the student gets confused on a problem and the computer can read that they are confused and it notifys the teacher the teacher can go over and help the student.

In the classroom there are some students who don't like speaking out or ask questions because they are shy or don't feel smart because they have to ask questions but in this way they won't have to deal with any of that because the computer reads that they are having trouble. In the article it says that Dr. Huang could read how Mona Lisa was feeling just by a computer telling him. This system could also be a way to teach kids how to read how people are really feeling because in today's world no one can fully read how people are feeling.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang says "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too"" computers should understand that so they can read how people are feeling to make things easier. The computers in todays society hare very good technology but i think this would make it better. In most schools nowadays the students already have lap tops so this would be a great idea.

All schools should have this system. This system will help out students dramaticly. This system wont make them get out of there comfort zone to ask a teacher for help instead the teacher will come to them.",0
"Although some says that inactivity serve a purpose, because the can get more time to them selves then when they are in activities, actually determine never to be idle, because we can accomplish many things; If we are always doing somethings such as involving in activities, having more time with our book, and trying out new things.

It had been writing by Thomas Jefferson "" Determine never to be idle "". It is very true that some many people and students are always idle; they don't use their time wisely. We can do a lot if we involved our selves in activities instead of been idle; for example, when I came to the United States in January 8,2017. I was sitting at home for two months without going to school, and doing nothing. I got tired of been idle, so I told my mother that I wanted to something instead of been idle. I wanted to sign up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, so that I can get busy with my time, and use it wisely. I finally signed up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, and I got accepted by the coach. I started training with new people, and I made a lot of friends.

Instead of been idle, why can't we spend more time with our books? The more we go close to our books the more we learn faster, and increase our skills in reading; for example, my friend Generic_Name, his parents never wanted him to hang out with friends that much, or neither been idle without having his book to read. Generic_Name kept on spending most of his time reading his books for a long time, and he became a good reader in his English classroom. The teacher always asked him to read out story books and passages to his classmates in school. He inspired many students in his school, and most students wanted to be like him, so they started having more time with their books at home.

In addition, people who wanted to be idle, or people who think inactivity serve a purpose are people who are not determine, and not planing on their future; they don't want to involve in activities, or interact with people. Idle people are lazy, because they don't want to try out new things. try out new things when ever you are idle. You can learn a lot even if you are not perfect; for example, me and my three friends Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name. We were sitting at home idly doing nothing; until when Generic_Name suggested that we should go and try out the UFC GYM. We went there, and signed up for the training; they gave us a one day trail to see if we would like the training. We went there the next day and started training for one hour; after training I told my friends that I don't like the training, because it was gave me back pains, so I quit the gym, and my three stayed in the training, because they like it. I was not perfect, but I tired out a new thing and I got some experiences from it.

As a result of all the reasons and examples. I encourage every idle human and people who thinks inactivity server a purpose to get engage in activities, having more time with their books, and trying out new things when ever they feel like they are idle. You can do a lot if you try out new things. We can accomplish more if we are always doing somethings; therefore, determine never to be idle.",0
"The cities of Vauban, Germany Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia all have something in common. They have all taken measures to use cars minimally for at least a small period of time. The results of car use are pollution and accidents among other large scale issues. The cities previously mentioned, however, have taken active roles in preventing these issues. It is no guess as to why the pollution is created ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" states Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times. A seemingly simple, but effective, idea could prevent the pollution caused by cars limiting car usage. Cars have been a major cause of stress with people who always rush to arrive at their destinations, and social interaction in person has significantly shot onto the negative end of the spectrum because of the invention of cars. By limiting car usage, the overly tense and smogged communities alike would benefit.

A frustrated, tense driver is not an uncommon occurrence. The term ""road rage"" was not spontaneously thought of. The purpose of cars is to transport someone or something from destination ""A"" to destination ""B"" in a short amount of time. This makes the very nature of cars one of urgency and with urgency comes stress. Stressed drivers have been the cause of many a car accident. All it takes is someone who is almost late for a meeting to speed too quickly for an accident to occur. Cutting down on car usage would exponentially decrease the number of car accidents, and it is likely to increase the overall happiness of a community that harbors less cars on their streets. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter of Vauban, Germany. The community of Vauban has given up their cars. In fact, there are only two places to park there the parking garage requires a 40,000 fee to reserve a space, and it is rare to find a private garage for a home. Vauban is an example of what is likely the beginning of more communities based on minimal car use. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" states David Goldberg, official of Transportation of America. ""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communities..."" Elisabeth Rosenthal Communities are realizing the benefits of reduced usage.

An astounding statistic: ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Elisabeth Rosenthal Pollution is the main concern for the generation of fossil fuel consumers. It is not unknown that cars cause pollution because of the diesel and gasoline that fuels the car. The pollution cars bring will not cease to multiply until cars are used less, and hybrid cars are not necessarily the answer because there has always been controversy on whether people will actually buy them with time. Cities who ban car usage see significant changes in the quality of their atmosphere and an example of this is Paris. Paris, the travel destination of both adventurers and lovers, experiences some of the worst pollution even when compared to Beijing, China. ""Congestion car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" stated Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune. Paris benefited from the bans and reduced the amount of smog in the city. Paris took action on their car usage issue and it would be beneficial for other places to follow suit as pollution is an increasinly major environmental issue and health hazard.

Not only would pollution be shifting downward, but city projects would improve with the limited use of automobiles. Cars promote the improvement of highways and roads. This creates a situation in which the city funds the roads, but fails to focus on other important city structures such as sidewalks and local stores. Roads are constantly run down and massive amounts of tax money go into repairing them, but limiting car usage would prevent road damage and change the city's view on other structures. Bogota, Columbia has a ""Day without Cars"" to ""...promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,"" states Andrew Selsky of Seattle Times. With just one day reserved for not using cars, ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Andrew Selsky Reducing car use enhances the experience of those who normally don't use cars because of improved bike paths, sidewalks, and is the foundation for a more lively city community.

Luckily, the United States seems to already be on the path to lowering numbers of cars used. ""...Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by,"" states Elisabeth Rosenthal from "" "" . America is one of the biggest mascots of the car industry they have always been on top of advertisement and 'showing off cars' with companies such as Ford and Mercedes. The decline of car usage is beneficial in America for the environment as emissions will be lowered, but the car companies would need to find a different tactic to generate or maintain money flow. The resulting effect is that not only would limiting car usage aid the environment, decrease stress levels, and promote structural integrity of a city, but it would be the dawn of a new cultural age based on a community that has a better transportation system to ""...conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety,"" as proposed by Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Limiting car usage will usher in a healthier age for the younger generations.",0
"Dear Senator,

I would like to take this time into explaining why having the Electoral College is not a good idea in determining who would become our president. Why should anyone be voting if in the article it states

""

It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

If the Electoral College is irrational and outdated, then why do we keep using? Popular voting can be a better idea then using the Eleortial College, with the popluar voting we can the president that makes the United

States a better place to be living in. For the past century there has been war and terroist in the U.S, and the cause to all the violence is because when Senators are suppose to represent our state they say what in their favor. IF we focus on what the people want we will have a better chance of stopping all the battle. People that are serving the armed forces can come home to their children and family, the local news will not talk abou the next war and the disagreement that this country has aganist another.

If we begin to use popluar vote we can begin to have more and more people voting. Many citzens do not vote because they think that their votes do not count or aren't counted. With popular vote they can be sure that they will be counted and that the votes are for the people not for the Senator. As we get older, this country will not ben the same as before or how it was in the 1800's, we are goinmg to start changing the things that we think are best for this country, we do not want to start the same wars we did centuries ago. Improving it would mean to take risk and if we have to change Electoral College to popular vote, then so be it and let's change it.

I suggest for now on instead of using Electoral College we start using popular votings. If there is ever a case where the votes come out teied then we instead on using Electoral College, this would of be if there were to ever be a tired in the voting session. If this country is all in choices of the people and for the people why can we start to use popular vote instead.",0
"I think the author did a great job explaining venus and it's many complications.

Venus has been a sister panet to us for a long time but we still have yet to properly explore it because of its harsh conditions. Venus is very hot, on average it is over 800 degrees fahrenheit, so it makes it almost impossible to have anything land on it. The author explains how NASA is planning on approaching the heat.

Many people believe that Venus may have used to have been able to support life. Venus was known to have bodies of water at some point in time and has other forms of landscape like valleys, mountains, and craters.

If we could just get to Venus to check out whats going on, it could help us in the future, and i'm interested in knowing now if we ever will, i like how much information the author provided in this text",0
"Space exploration is a growing topic. NASA has sent rovers to Mars and landed people on the moon but they cannot seem to figure Venus out.

The author of this article titled ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has explained why Venus is such a hard planet for space explorers very well.

Venus could have been a planet just like Earth, according to the author. The author of the article first hits the readers with information about Venus and compares it to the planet we live on. If Venus is so close to being Earth's twin then why is it challenging to explore it? In the third paragraph the author states, ""On the planet's surface [Venus], the temperatures average 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "" These facts are on of many reasons as to why Venus is challenging to explore.

NASA is looking into these invention or solutions that need to be addressed to even have a chance at making to Venus. The author said that there are things that could be done to help us get to Venus' surface but it is not around yet, which is another reason it is challenging to explore Venus. We cannot succsessfully make it there yet.

Venus is dangerous. From what space explorers can tell the planet can be similaer to Earth or was similar to Earth. The author says, ""... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective,"" this means that touching down on Venus'surface isour best chance on discovering what might have been living on Venus or what may possible show up. NASA has been trying to find other life or signs of life for many years and the planet that finally may show signs of possible life they're unable to reach.

The author has presented may facts and statistics within this article. They brought up the fact that space explorers cannot reach the planet/reach the planet and survive, how it is different from Earth, and why NASA wants answers to the questions they have on Venus.",0
"Fresh clean air, spotless streets and no car accidents. Welcome to Vauban, Germany. The 5,500 people of this town are a part of something that this day and age has never seen. The residents here have given up their cars, and are a part of an experiment where their streets are completely ""carfree""!

After this experiment started in Germany, it's population would agree that the tenseness they were feeling with their cars is now gone. This new way of living was started in 2006 and other countries would agree that it is a smart move and an affordable way of living. The residents of Vauban have more money to spend on other necessities such as clothing and food, or maybe some entertainment, even. All of their monthly car payments and gasoline bills have ceased to exist because they simply have no reason to pay the prices anymore without a car. Citizens of this little town don't have to walk or ride their bikes far because the city has thought this movement out very well. All of the stores are placed just a walk away rather than their malls being placed on a distant highway. Public transportation has become more accessible and there is more space for sidewalks rather than roads. For some, this is a dream town for them and their children. There isn't much of a worry about air pollution or accidents.

If you were to compare vaughn's air pollution to being's the difference would be astounding. Just last night, NBC Nightly News showed the city of Bejing where the smog was so dense that visibility was reduced to almost none. The majority of the population won't go outside with out wearing a mask to protect them selves. All of the air pollutants could be harming us even with a potential risk of lung cancer. The mayor of Bejing has even made a statement talking about his city's air, and the risk and threat it poses to his residents. Even the common person will recognize that the gas emissions from a car's tail pipe equals pollution. Paris officials knew this too, and understood that their city had an air cleanliness issue. So, in an effort to make the City of Love more pleaseable they limited what cars could drive on what days. They enforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog in the city. For a short amount of time only evennumbered cars, for example, could drive on a Monday. If odd numbered cars were on the street then there would be a 22 Euro fine that equals 31 USD's. After 5 days, car traffic and conjestion was down around 60% on the streets, and the air pollution started clearing.

Fatal crashes are among the one of the third highest risks for all American's. Some states have even made it a law to not text and drive, and in some states there probably is a ""no talking on the cell phone law"" too! If the number of cars are reduced or taken away all together I feel that the lives of the American people are less at risk. Every day, and not just in this country, hundreds of people are injuring them selves or getting killed by distracted driving, hitandruns, and driving under the influence. It could be beneficial to cut down the car usage and up the number of public transportation avaible to the public.

In any major city you go to in the United States, all around you, you can notice the large amounts of people walking to where they need to go. In Washington D.C. bike rentals are EVERYWHERE. And if you don't want to take a bike then take the D.C. Metro. The same will go for New York City or anywhere with a large population of people. You will also notice that city folk tend to be slimmer than others. That is most likley due to the fact that they walk everywhere. Just like I mentioned before, like Vauban, eveything in a major city is usually within walking distance. As we all know, walking is a form of excersize and it is recomemnded by health officials that each person should get at least 1 hour every day and it is very believeable that a city goer gets plenty more than the recomended. The first lady has started a program for children in an effort to get them moving, fit and healthy as well. Some children in New York City won't even drive a single day in their lives or worry about what could happen if they do. Also, the Capital of ColombiaBogota has organized a day for it's residence to avoid taking their car. It is called the Day Without Cars and the major goal is to reduce smog and promote walking.

All in all.. Cars, the most dangerous driving force in our daily lives, should be cut back on. Even with study after study coming out and proving just how danger and nonbeneficial to our health they are, they are slowly losing populatiry. If this pattern stays consistant then sociologists say that it will have great effects on the atmosphere, and our healthy lives that we all live.",0
"Although limiting car usage may seem out of the ordinary, it has many benefits that appeal to people. By limiting car usage, people save money, the air isn't being poluted as much and there aren't as many traffic jams.

For starters, not having or using a vehicle is a huge money saver. For example, a German suburb, Freiburg, near French and Swiss borders allow the use of cars, but is somewhat strict. Rosenthal states, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Not only does it cost 40,000 just for that but gas and fixups go along with having a car.

Secondly, the less people use vehicles, the less air pollution is going to be created. For instance, Paris issued a driving ban in an effort to ""clear the air of the global city."" Duffer says, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" The smog that affects Paris is also known to ""rival"" with Bejing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By banning car usage for a day, the air had a chance to breathe and is overall healthier for the people that live in that area.

Lastly, it's obvious to say that with less car usage, the more likely it is to have a decrease in number of traffic jams. To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" It's a positive thing to have ""carfree day"" because less accidents mean less people getting injured.

To conclude, limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing.",0
"There have been conspiracy theories going around that the Face on Mars is actually created by aliens, but it can be proven to everyone that the claims are false. The Face is simply a natural landform, and NASA is not trying to hide or distort the truth. Some may still be skeptical, but there is proof that the Face is not an alien monument of any sort.

As stated before, the Face is actually a natural landform. It's the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa found commonly in the American West. Fellow researcher, Jim Garvin, even states that it reminds him of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho""(paragraph 12). It can be proven that Earth landforms definitely aren't made from aliens, and the same could be said for the Face.

The Face isn't even an actual face, so it's unlikely it even is an alien monument. The only reason the rock formation resembles a face is because the shadows cast an illusion of facial features such as eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Pictures of the Face were captured two other times using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Skeptics may believe that NASA messed up somewhere or that something was flawed, but it is highly unlikey that this is true. The procedure was performed on a cloudless summer day with the best camera at NASA's disposal.

Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face wasn't created by aliens, believing that NASA is just attempting to hide the evidence of an ancient civilization. In truth, this is false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life. How can one believe NASA is keeping secrets about alien life from the public when it would benefit to do the opposite. Proof of an alien civilization would be more helpful to share than hiding it, so why do people believe otherwise?

Whether or not people believe the Face is actual just a Martian landform, it doesn't affect the researchers of NASA. Evidence to support the claim has been provided, but what proof do the skeptics have? Can they really disprove the truth or are they just desperate for attention?",0
"It'd be better to stay with the Electoral College when it comes to voting for the president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with every state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. Overall the Electoral College tries to keeps things fair for everyone. The Electoral College so far hasn't made a big mistake or elect a horrible president, so there's no need to mess with the voting system. Without the Electoral College, California would have the most votes put in to elect a president.

If there was no Electoral College all these little states like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states like California. Richard A. Posner states ""other things being equal, a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does"" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or large states. The one big problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost all of the U.S. not voting for their president but instead for the people who vote for them.

Even though that is a pretty big problem, it does help keeps things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region like the South aren't praised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were up to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president""(Posner,19). The same paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to elect a president.

Within the Electoral College are people who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as president. If it were up to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed up. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearences but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more popular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keep the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the people when voting for president. They try tp evenly distribute the votes with each state,they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keep things fair for everyone so that we can all be happy.",0

People could use this technology to shovel ads into your face, and they will. I do have another thought on this though, it could be used to help people in need, people such as abuse victims. A lot of people try to hide deppresion, and this technology could be used to make the growing suicide rate in America plummet like a bag full of cylinder blocks, in the ocean. Surely this tech is flawed in many ways as it is made by humans, and we are not perfect by any means, I mean you can't always tell how someone is feeling based only on their face. This technology, can be frustrating, as well as life saving.",0
"Seeking advice from multiple people can help you in many ways. If you seek advice from people, you can gain more knowledge and could learn new things! When you have trouble with something and you have no one to ask, then it would be hard for you to learn and understand. The more people you talk to,the more knowledge you gain and study. Seeking advice from multiple people can help you because you can learn, understand, and think of new ways to create.

If you talk to only one person, you won't get that much advice from them, however, when you talk to multiple people, you will most likely have more advice. Learning can help you a lot and you will need it in the future. Learning things like math, science, English, etc. could help you in getting jobs, and you might use it in your life. You can learn by going to school, or you could ask people around you. That is why I think taking peoples advice can help you learn a lot.

If you learn something new, you must always understand the topic so you can use that advice later on. Understanding makes you progress things in your mind, so you can understand more clearly. If you don't clearly understand what the topic is about, you could ask the teacher or your friends for help. Some people understand more than others, so you can always ask when you dont understand. There are a lot of ways you could understand, for example, listening to peoples advises, and write down notes so you can go back and read when you don't understand.

Taking advice from people can help you think of new ways. It could help by using their information and creating something new, like an invention. You can use math to find the longitude and latitude, or make treatments for the sick by using science. Everything that you learn can make new inventions in the future and could save a person's life. That is why learning new things and using it for ideas can be really helpful and good for people.

Taking advice from people can help people in many ways and could affect our future. Learning from multiple people can help you gain and understand more things that you might need help with. Every advice from a different person will not be the same because some people are smarter than others. If you have a question, or have trouble with something, learing more from people could help you in the present and in the future. And that is why taking advice from people can help you in many ways, and understand more clearly about the question you are having trouble on.",0
"The process of the election of the president of the United States is somewhat ambigous. The Electoral College basically controls the shifts between the competion, in a way that some rare cases in which a candidate loss the presidential election because of the amount of votes the Electoral college. The Electoral College should be abolished, not only is it unfair but irrational.

The Electoral College basically chooses for the people in some of the pass elections. The process of the voting in The Electoral College consists of five hundred and thirty eight electors, but only the majority of two hundred seventy electoral votes are required to elect the President. The Electoral College has a method to over rule by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes a winner. When the people in general vote for a candidate  they sometimes vote for a slate of numerous democratic or republican electors. We as the people not all the time but it happens, get puzzled when voting. When it comes to applying what you know about your future President some of the voting body doesnt know what candidate to decide on, since some times the candidates have similar campaign goals.

Some states called Swing States contain the people that pay really close attention to the candidates campaigns. The voters that pertain to these states want to really listen to what their prefered candidate has to offer, as well as the the opponents campaign. Now people really need to have an actual choice over who their countrys leader is, for some people they are fine with the Electoral College taking their vote and only think of it as a vote.

In conclusion, I think that we the people need our votes to count as well and even more then the Electoral College just for the reason that we are voting for the person who will lead our country for four terms. In the end the Electoral College needs to be abolished for our vote to count.",0
"The Electoral College has been in the Constitution since out founding fathers established it. It was an agreement between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of President by a popular vote of citizens.

As we all know the Electoral College is a process which is the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are two political parties. Democrats and Republicans. Electors are usually chosen by the person running for office's political party, but each state has their different views on how they are selected and what their responsibilities are. When the time comes, usually every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, presidential elections are held. This is the day citizens go out to their local polls and help their electors vote for President. It's not the citizens themselves who vote for the President, when citizens vote they're actually voting for their candidates electors. The process of the Electoral College has been carried on since it was first put into the constitution. So, why change it now?

The Electoral College consists of over 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. The citizens vote sometime in November in polls and wait for the election of the new President. As stated before, the citizens vote does not elect the president, it helps the electors choose. However, that doesn't mean that the citizens don't have a purpose in voting. Popular vote is part of an election as well. It is rare that the Electoral College is higher in numbers that its popular votes. This is sometimes because states award electoral votes on a winnertakesall rubric.

This process requires a candidate to have transregional appeal, meaning there aren't favorites. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This also means the presidential candidate will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states they know they'll win in. This is a highly unlikely result that will outcome as a successful president. If this were to occur, voters in other states would feel discouraged and feel as if their votes do not count. This is why the Electoral College has this as a requirement.

In most tossup states, voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and deciding or knowing who that they will decide to be president. They are most likely thoughtful voters and are perferred to be the ones to decide the election. In big states, the Electoral College adjusts the weight in the political balance that these states lose by population. In additon, large states get more attention of candidates in a campaign that the smaller states do.

These are just few of many resons why the Electoral college should stay as is. If they were to change the Electoral College, what would they do to elect a president? It would be chaotic and the people may rebel. In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College as it is should be the only process to elect a president.",0
"Technology is being used in a variety of different ways. It can find anything asked to find, do anything asked to do, it make you happy, sad, feel any emotion known to man. Technology that can recognize when the owner is upset then turn the emotions around to being happy is on it's way. The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enabling computers to identfy students emotions in the classroom is a great idea to have. It can make school and simply just school a better experience for the students and for the teachers.

If a student gets bored while working on a assignment on the computer then the new FACS technology could change that. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused ot bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" That means whenever the student is getting bored of the lesson and wants to stop working then the technology would see that the student is getting sidetracted and change the lesson up a little bit so the student would keep working and get involved again. The teacher would have to do less work because they wouldn't have to yell at the kids to get back to work, the computer could get them to work again. It benefits the both the student and the teacher by not letting the kid fall behind in school work and making the day easier on the teacher.

Humans don't communicate or talk about emotions anymore. Way back then when there wasn't any technology people would interact with each other and talk about enotions. Now that there's technology everywhere you look people have their faces stuck into it and don't socialize. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" What Dr. Huang is saying is completely true, people don't talk and socialize anymore, so if everyone has technology and is always using it then the new technology FACS is a great thing for technology to have. When someone is upset and sad and just on a phone or computer it will recognize that and make things on the screen pop up that made you happy and smile before. It would be a great addition to technology at school, if a student is having a bad day and gets on the computer the computer will see the emotion and make things pop up or try something different to make the student happy and stop being upset.

Anatomy is about people, the body, and how muscles and everything works to move and show emotion. In paragrapgh five it stats ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" That shows that Dr. Huangs technology knows exactly how people show emotion and move and everything. The technology would be spot on and be able to tell that the student is drifting away from the lesson and getting distracted, then the technology can make it more interesting. Then the student would start to work again and be able to work while having fun and being happy at the same time.

Dr. Huangs technology system known as Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would be a great thinig to have at schools everywhere. The technology would be ableto know when the student was getting confused and bored and modify the lesson or activity to make it easier and more fun for the student. It would make students grades go up as the technology makes the lesson easier for the student to understand and do. The technologhy knows exactly when to change the lesson up and when to try to make the sudent smile and happy again. The new technology FACS by Dr. Huang would be a great addition to computers and technology at school.",0
"I bielive that this computer system is vauleable because this can tell emotions, it may also help you communicate,and help teachers with students.

This system can reconize your emotions. Many peolpe tend to hide their emotions .In the Mona Lisa she is eighty-three percent happy,nine percent disgusted,six percent fearful,and two percent angry. This computer system software helped the Mona Lisa's emotions,which can help us too. This process begins when the compyter constructs a 3D computer model of the face all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Emotion,moving your facialmuscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may even help produce them.

Another reason is this may help you with communication ,this software can help you communicate. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie these muscle cluses are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isnt't being truthful. This helps weather someone fake smiles to you or not. In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. This computer system knows if you are faking it.

This software may also help teachers out. This computer system can tell if students are bored in class,or if they are confused .This system can tell teachers that students need more review on the lesson .This may be a great a idea niot only it helps teachers but,human communcation is nonverbal,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too.

I bielive this is a great idea because,it helps us with our emotions and communicate with others,and help teahers out with students.

This computer software is very benefial for all of us so I agree to this we need to step our game up,and know what peolpe feel by the help of theses great system we have.",0
"Facial Action Coding System is a form of technology that people are using to be able to tell how some ones feeling by using a computer to constructa 3d model of the face and study all the muscles in the model to see what you are feeling. i just going say it this just sound like a waste of time and money.

it a waste of time because i think we could be able to do more thing then finding out people emoitions instead we could have be able to help out people with cte of any other major pshycologic disies instead its just focussing ono emotion and yes i understand emotions can help us diagnos people with those issues but all i hear i this passage is about emotions nothing else . this is also a huge waste of money,why the technology being used sound like its cost a bunch of money to produce.",0
"The Electoral College was a system thought up by people who lived in a time much different than our own. And in that time, it made sense. It made sure that those who cast their state's votes for president, the electors, were well informed on the issues and the stance of the candidates for those issues. However, now that everyone has access to a wealth of information through the internet, newspapers and television, this is no longer a problem this is why election by popular vote would be a better system.

With the Electoral College, voters don't have a direct say on who becomes president. They have to trust their votes in the hands of people they don't even know. People who could cast their state's votes for any candidate they want. This system is completely unnecessary now that citizens have a wealth of information about the candidates and their stance on certain topics.

If our nation switched to election by popular vote, everyone's vote would matter. In the Electoral College system, many people in states that are decisively one way or the other, don't vote, knowing that the overwhelming majority of the population of their state is against them. This makes certain people, like Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California, feel that their vote has no power. In an election by popular vote however, every vote matters because the people's votes directly decide the president.

Our Founding Fathers were geniuses to have come up with a system that worked so well in their time, however, old methods don't always stand the test of time. Election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world. The Electoral College eliminates the power of some people's votes and puts those that matter in the hands of people who could do whatever they want with them. This is why election by popular vote would be a better system for determining the president than the Electoral College.",0
"Do you think that the first impression can change my statement?

some people change the statement with the impressions for to made best result or to have a bets answer, therefore not all people can make this possible,

but while the people always try the bets.

i'm disagree because, based on my experience some time i said my first impression, and its hard to change, but is not impossible all is possible if you try the best, my mom said that you always have to change the first impression if is not correct.

My mom said that you always have to change the first impression, because you will be more secure of what you doing, and your life will be more better, and safe, I remember that she always toll me becarefool of what you choice, because that what you do in the present will affect your future.

Some time you have to think of what you choice, and i choice that i'am disagree, because i said if you think two time your impression your impression will be better if you said a best impression, so you have to think what you said because if is not correct you will have a big problem.

Should the people said the first impression, but if you see that you first impression is not correct you have to change the first impression, and make a better impression, because two is better than one. ",0
"The electoral college is pointless, I believe that it is just another step that was added to the long process of picking our new president. It causes problems between the people and the government and it takes away time that we could be using to do something actually beneficial to our country. The electoral college is not a place but a group of people who meet and vote for the President and Vice President. Each state gets represented by a certain amount of electors which is decided by the population of that specific state. The electoral college should be thrown out of the way that we choose our president because it upsets the people, it can completley change elections, and because it gives to much power to the legislative branch.

I think that the electoral college gets people frustrated with our government. They have to go basically vote for another person to vote. If I lived in texas I would go to a poll and vote for the person that I wanted to put up in the electoral college. That person would then vote for the president. It makes voters, mad why spend time for voting on people who you dont really care about when you could honeslty just vote for the President who you believe could help our country. The biggest argument against the electoral college is that it we can't control who our elector votes for. You see when you go to vote for an elector you normally vote for one who says that they are going to vote for the person that you like, but they can change their mind and now you voted for someone that is going to vote for the candidate that you didnt want.

The electoral college can completely change the direction of a vote. because voters only have one vote, the electors represent alot of the states population. For example a single representative from samller states like Wyoming can represent of to 500,000 voters and in bigger states like California can have up to 55 electors who represent as much as 35 million people. This is why the electoral college can have such a big effect on the voting proces especially since the electors represent such a large amount of people. It can become frustrating when a large mass of people elect some one and that elector changes there mind about who they vote for, because a group of people as large as 500,000 can be ruiting for one person and the elector can change his mind and now that group 500,000 is voting for someone that they don't like.

Another problem is that the electoral college gives to much power to legislative branch ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy because it would have been overthrown by the college. Which meens that the Legislative branch has enough power to create a biased slait. The legislature would create a group of electors that are all in favor of certain idea and you wouldnt be able to vote for anyone else because those are the people for your state. The point of voting is to give power to the people and with the electoral college in the way it completely takes that away from us. We get to vote for the electors but that doesnt meen that they are going to vote for the people that we want them to.

Yes the electoral college could have some advantages like allowing professionals to have an input into what is going on, It helps us avoid runoff elections elections that end up with a tie, and restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. But there are definalty more cons to this procedure. The constitution states that we are here to create a more perfect union but how are we supposed to create a union when the government is basically in control of everything. There is no unity gouing on in our government it more like the government is in charge and we are kind of just here. If we get rid of the electoral college it will make the people happier and allow them to actually feel like part of the government, It will stabilize elections and not allow the legistaure to change them, and will take away some of the numerous powers that the Legislative branch holds. All in all the electorla cllege os unfair, outdated, and irrational.",0
"Each school study more that one hundred students. Many students in high school took not much hard subjects, most of them are art and music . Educational programs alredy have to take courses during the summer, if student don't finish important subjects.

"Everyone is different. The experiences people have and genes they get are all different. People often have varying cultures, beliefs, and backgrounds. This diversity, however, can be used to an advantage by seeking out many different people when it come to advice. It is important to ask multiple people for advice because people often have multiple opinions, different experiences, and different perspectives on looking at things.

First and foremost, it is important to ask multiple people for advice because people often have multiple opinions and ideas for what to do. For example, one time I was fencing and my next bout was against a tough opponent. The opponent's skill was far beyond mine, however, if I learned how he fenced and how to counter him, I might be able to beat him. I asked many different people about how to counter him and they all told me different things. Even though everyone told me something different, I could use this knowledge to my advantage and combine my knowledge about him in the past to formulate a plan and act on it. In the end, I won all my bouts and ended up winning the tournament. This shows that even though multiple people may have good advice on what to do, the wisdom of the crowd is ultimately the best option. This means that combined, many people together is smarter than any one person, and this will help a person get better advice.

In addition, it is important to multiple people for advice because different people have different experiences on what to do. Some people went through the exact same problem, so they may have better advice than those who have never been through it. They also might have an idea that has not been thought of by me, but will easily solve the problem. Due to their experiences, people only think a certain way, and somebody might have a way that is perfect for this problem. Advice comes in many different ways, and different people have different strategies for succeeding in life. What will work for one person may not work for another, which is why people need different advice. For example, quotes are a type of advice, however they are written by countless different people. The different experiences of people can guide them to look at things differently which leads to my final point.

It is important to ask multiple people for advice because people have different perspectives on looking at things. Throughout a person's lifetime, they have experienced many different things, and learned from those experiences. Everyone has different experiences, and a different perspective to things. This way, asking different people for advice would help that person get a different outlook on the problem, and a different perspective on the problem. This will help them understand the full problem. It is also important to get an understanding of the way other people think. Different people think in different ways, so even if nobody comes up with advice on the problem, the way they think could inspire another person to come up with a solution to the problem.

In conclusion, it is important to ask many different people for advice because people have different ideas, experiences, and perspectives. America is a diverse country, and that is what makes it strong. The diversity of people is something to take advantage of, not ignore, and different people produce different advice. In America, people are luckier than most, because of the vastly different cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs. The tools are there for people to use if they chose to do so.",0

Finally i will expain how to take decisons, and to make them work. This may prove that individuality doesn't change the you can not be, what you want be.

There are many ways the can be a ocation of individuality. In your job, might be someone you do not like, because his or her behave. You can try to work with the person, is not just be a individual person, beause you might need the help of the person one day. If your try to work with the person to broke the individuality between the person in you, that can be a avance to be relative to other people. Another occasion on individuality in your job can might be because, you are not doing what you dreamed about to be in the future. The doesn't mean the you can not fight to get your goal, if you don't like your job try to do something the you like been working in a job that you don't like is typical of individuality behave. Many companies work together as a team to get there goels, you can work with other people in your job as a company.

Some people prefert to be alone in many times, these people we can know as asocial. This people just want to be alone becuase they feel comfortable like that. There another people the doesn't like to be around others people, because they like to do the things by there own. They like to be the one the everyone see, the point of attention these people we can call as indiviluatys. Not all them are the like that, because there might be a reason to makes them to be like that. Maybe for their background. Be around of society is sometimes is more complicate then what it looks, mostly if you know people like that, but you can try to work with them or somethings these people chage. Some them beacuse they look for help and others change because someone close to them help to change for good.

We all make decisions in life but some those decisons can make us to do something wrong or to be a different person. Try to be anoter person is not just to want to be the person is to make a decision. You can make the decision to be push it by the world, or you can make your own decision of what you want to do in life. Many people take the decision to stay in a world that management their life, because they think the is better or because is the easy way. The president can deciside to work alone, and make the things as he wants but he knows the he needs to work together, we the people in the congress beacuse by himself can not do everything. As the president we can make the same, decision as him to work together or not. you can make your own goal to fight for what you want or to be constantly push it by the world to change you to be something else.

In summary we all have the decision to select which way to follow. As i went throught about job and result. Also i wrote about hoe we can live around the society, and how we can result conflicts. Finally i explaned how we can take are own decision, to be what we want to do, and what can be goal to follow to change, or fight for it. This can be a result the Ralp Waldo Emerson, is wrong about to be push it by the world constantly, beacuse you change that and be what you want to be.",0
"Value of Face Action Coding Systems in Schools Today,

I believe that in some cases face recogniton in classrooms could be slightly valuable but overall I think that there would be more negative effects than positive effects when it comes to Face Action Coding on school computers. Some negative effects of the Face Action Coding System could be things like innacurate face readings, more difficult or ineffective way of learning, or minimization of comunication and decreased likelyhood of relationships between students and their teachers. These examples lead me to think that facial recognition is not important for schools to have for their students.

If the face coding software was inacurate, your work would be effected in ways you might not want it to be or you could come off a different way than you are really feeling. In the text it state that the software can detect if a person beomes confused or bored with something if you make a certan facial expression. Once this happens the information would get relayed back to your teacher so he or she can make ajustments for your assignment if needed, but what if the facial expression that was made was totally erellevant to your assignment. As I do assignments I sometimes think about other things and make facial expressons about my thoughts. Maybe the expression of confusion or bordum might cross my face and get relayed back to the teacher when the facial expression made was not made because of the assignment. These are examples of how facial recognition could be giving incorrect information back to teachers.

If the computer could tell ever emotion you had towards your assignment you would never need to actually communicate face to face with your teacher. The author shows in the text that as the emotions are detected, the teacher would give modifycations to the assignment without you even asking them to or asking for help. Most communication between teachers and students is done by asking questions about assignments and how they feel about something in the class. I believe that students should be able to speak face to face to the people assigning their work instead of turning away from most communication between students and teachers.

To me I can see the Facial Coding System effecting the learning of students. In the text it states that it can modify the assignmets just like a teacher would if it detects signs of being confused or bored. If a student is neither bored or confused but the computer detects that by their facial expression, then it could change the assinment even if the student didn't need the assignment changed. This would either give the student a break by making the assignmet too easy or it would push the student out of where they need to be by making the assignment harder. This would then effect how the student learns.

In conclusion, facial recogniton in classrooms will lead to more problems than it would help by bringing it into schools. I would rather share my emothions to a teacher when I felt the need to instead of a computer telling emotions back to my teacher that may be innacurate. I also would rather have a teacher giving me modified work so It would help me in learning. This is why I disagree with Facial Coding Systems in schools today.",0
"Back in the day they did'nt have technology. They telephone to call they friends and mother & father. They couldn't not even go outside to see they friends they mother where so hard on them. Some would let them go over there friend house to have fun. Some had to stay home and clean up cook dinner and watch there little sister and brother didn't get to go nowwhere what to ever. It was a time they had to be in the house a certain time before the street light come on. Now, Parent letting there kids do what ever they want now. Now, They have internet, phone now, facebook, snapchat & twitter. Agnry on social media over boy and want to fight peolpe no reason. A bullying peolpe cause they look better den other people. Peolpe killing there self cause peolpe bullying. It a lot peolpe killing there self in different city and state for being pick on. And kids have so much anger on there self. Some peolpe need make a progra for these kids that has anger problem and wanna hurt there self. Some kids don't have mother and father they have to foster care. Till somebody take them in till there hand to peolpe there parent. Some teenger will live with there boyfriend insted of there father and mother. That you will have happiness, surprise,anger,disgust, fear, and sadness on your self. And then associated each with characteristic movement of the facial muscles in your body. Some peolpe bring you down you have to get back up and stay in a good ways. Some classroom computer - animated faces move expressive- for video games or video surgery. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's - feet around your eyes. The expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spowhen a smiling politician or celebrity isn;t being truthful. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.",0
"How do you think the Face was formed. There could be many reasons how the Face was formed. However I think that the Face was not formed by aliens. One reason is, is that they haven't prove that aliens are real yet. Also, that the day they took they picture they said that there was wispy clouds over it. Another reason is that it all happend because of science.

Mars is an odd planet, I've heard people call it the pizza planets because it was red, I think. That's not the point though, the point is, is that the planet has not proven that aliens live on that planet. The face had been thought it was created by aliens. NASA said that the Face was a ""huge rock formation"" showing the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. There are more reasons why they face was Face was not formed by aliens.

Another reason is that the day they took the picture, there was wispy winds. In order to take a good picture you need to have good weather. The weather can effect the picture because if it's windy you need to make sure that everything is not blowing around. The wispy winds could have effected the picutre becuase the winds were blowing so the rocks, sand and everything else was blowing around. So, when Viking 1 captured that picture, it can everything else blowing with it. Wind storms happen on planets, I am not sure om which ones but i know they happen-just like how on the sun it doesn't have wind storms but has almosr like volcanic action on it with lave everywhere. There is one more other reason.

One more reason is that is just plain old science. Science occurs in a lot of discussing and working on the planet. When planning to send some sort of machine to a planet, you have to undertand the planet. In 1976 there wasn't the best technology at the time. They didn't know when a storm was gonna come or if they would have to send their machines threw a bunch of metors. When they sent out Viking 1 a win storm occured and the camera on Viking 1 couldn't focus right and that is why it looked like a face.

There are many more reasons why the Face was not formed but an aliens. Some are that it was that aliens have not been proven yet. Also, that there was wispy clounds. One more is that is was all science. Those are resons why that the Face was not formed by aliens.",0
"Some people believe in different things such as aliens for example, but what about you?

We all heard about the ""face on Mars"" some might say it's real or others say is it NASA playing a trick on us? But it all started falling into place when we got some news about it.

I believe that this is real. No not the alien part but the face it's was fomred by natural landforms. Land forms can be created at any given moment - but this certain one just seemd to catch someone's eyes.

So on April 5, 1998 Michael and his Mars Orbiter camera took a shot of the ""face"" that made it look 10 times bigger than it was the viewers were shocked. Just as NASA revealed that it was only a natural land form. Some people weren't satisified just yet... they needed more information or did they want more to sound right?

So for quite awhile the argrument grew bigger on the big question "" Did aliens really make this?"" No one wanted to believe NASA because, they thought they knew more stuff than they were telling people. Maybe they wanted it to be something bigger or something better.....",0
"The author of this article uses many valid points and reasonings to support their idea. They refer to Earth and it's compatability to Venus a lot. They also use reasoning about Venus's temperatures and conditions. Although the author uses many disclaimers throughout the article, they still make good claims that studying Venus is worthy, despite the dangers.

In the second paragraph, the author states ""...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."". They are insuring that a helpful reason to research this planet would be because it is similar to earth, and a relative distance away. The author also states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."". This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well.

The author also gives ideas on how to help make a possible trip to Venus easier and less dangerous. They talk about using a bump-like vehicle that orbits or hovers about 30 miles above the surface. This vehicle has benefits, and also gives disclaimers. Some benefits would include astronauts being able to explore the land easier, avoiding the ""unfriendly"" ground, and keeping good air pressure. the text states ""however, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safey far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, redndering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This shows as a disclaimer to give unbiased proof ofnegative effects.

This article is full of evidence to support the authors idea of studying Venus. The author referred to Earth, recommended ideas, and a technology project used with old computers to support their claim. In conclusion, this article had very well put-together evidence, and proves a point that Venus should be studied despite the dangers.",0
"One major cause of global warning and greenhouse gases hurting our Earth and it's atmosphere is the excessive use of cars worldwide. Ever since they were invented, humans have naturally been attracted, but the attraction is turning dangerous. The amount of pollution these cars give off its sickening, and it's hurting us and nature. The amount of pollution was so deadly in Paris that they had to create and no-car day. Paris is so full of smog that people literally can not see. Everyone should cut back on the driving, it's becoming an epidemic. The upcoming generation of our children and our children's children needs to know the importance of conservation and helping the Earth, not destroying it.

Furthermore, less use of cars will actually lower the risk of death for pedestrians and drivers. thousands of deaths a year are from motor vehicle accidents. Not using cars as much or in general will lower the rate dramatically, obviously. The streets will be safer and more enjoyable for you and your children and your children's children.",0
"Consider  this,  instead  of  driving  to  work  everyday  why  ride  a  bike  or  walk there?  By  not  driving  in  a  car  you're  reducing  emmitions  that  go  into the  air.  But what  if  the distance  is  too  far  or  you  have  no  sense  of  direction?  That's  okay  because  what  do  you  have  on  you  twenty-four-seven?  You  can  always  use  your Iphone  for  directions.  Without  the  use  of  cars  it can  benifit  the community  and  ourselves  in  multiple  ways.

Yes,  cars  and  other  sources  of  transportation  are  great  but is doing  you  and  Earth  better?  Admit  it,  no. Driving  cars  increases  the  smog  in  your  area  espcially  if  you  live  in  Beijing,  China.

"The electoral college is a very important this to keep when desiding the presidentd. Our founding father established this process in the constitution. The president has to have transregional appeal he cant just have a lot of states on his side. it is true that public voters dont directly vote for the presidentt and sometimes the electors may not vote for the right person.

The process of the electoral college is writen in the constitution by our founding fathers. Its a compromise between congress votes and the peoples votes. To win the electoral votes you have to have 270 votes witch is the majority of the votes. Every candidatees has his or hers own group of electors that are choosen by the political party.

The presidenttal candidatee has to have transregional appeal because a candidatee with regional appeal is unlikely to win. If a candidatee were to campaign heavily in one region he or she will gain no electoral votes. so the candidatees have to go croos contry and not stick to one region to actully gain anything. A candidatee can make every person in one region vote for him. But the candidatee that go cross contry have a better chanse of wining because they have more electoral votes.

Yes a public vote does not go directly to helping a person win but it does help. if there were no electoral colled a candidate could go to all the heavily populated state and get all those votes and be puy in to office like that. Just because you are voting for a slate of electors does'nt mean you are not voting. The publics votes go twored helping choose the electors that vote for the presidentt.

The electoral college is a good thing to have when voting for the presidentt. Its a compromise between congress and the citizens thta was set by the founding fathers. It makes it so that a candidatee cant just win over one part of the connery and win he or she has to win over the majority of the people. Yes you are voting for people to vote for you but your votes choose those people. The electoral colleg is a grate prosse to have and keep.",0
"What are your thoughts on the face? Well I think that it was created by aliens. How is that even possible, how can you belive that the face was created by aliens. Well how could you possibly think that it is a humans face, thats impossible. When the team snapped a picture ten times more clear than the original Viking photos, and

When NASA posted the picture on a website, it revealed that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, also proving that it was not an alien monument in the first place.

But still after proving that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, still not everybody was satisfied. Some people still think that since it was cloudy at that time of the year, the camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy, white, and fluffy clouds to be able to see the face. Skeptics were still saying, ""Perhaps the alien marking were conseled by the wispy clouds.

NASA decided to go back to Mars on April 8, 2001, MGS came close enough to get a second look. The team captured an extraodinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resoultion.

"The author finds that studing Venus would be a good thing because of how it is or was similar to earth. There is evidence of Venus being largely being covered by oceans as weel as mountains and valleys with rocky sediments this may give clues or refrences about extraterestrial life that humans have been looking for. Even though exploration on the surface of venus may be near impossible for humans, machines may be able to explore a given time on the suface of Venus colecting samples from things like rocks.

Venus has analougous features that are similar to Earth and this may lead to certain discoverys about the potential of life that may have survived on Venus. Since Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth it makes reaching Venus easy but that dosent mean it is like our planet becuse of the atmosphere letting all of the heat inside. If we are able to explore Venus then it may give us confidence to expore other planets that may be like Venus. Finding other lifeforms of materials other than what is already on earth may be huge to humans and give us a boost in what we know as well as have.

This is why exploring Venus may be benificial to scientists to make any discoverys that will help the human race and possibly find another planet that sustains life or another planet to live on. Finding clues on Venus about the past may prove as a good thing as well possiblly telling us if planets go through phases where they can sustain life and when they can't. There may possibly be remains of a civilization on the other planets that we do not know about.",0
"Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes the capabilities of new software called the Facial Action Coding System, and provides a few examples of its possible uses. In the text, the author states that the technology, which evaluates the movement of facial muscles to determine emotion, could be beneficial in places such as a classroom settting. Using software such as the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in a classroom setting as it could improve the quality of learning for students.

The new emotion-reading technology could help in the classroom as it could make sure students stayed engaged in the lesson. Often in school, students become bored easily, due to lack of attention long attention spans, uninteresting lessons, or boring teachers. This technology could help eliminate bordom. In the article, Dr. Huang states that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student... [is] bored"" which would be beneficial, as it ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This means that this technology could tell if students are bored, and could alert the teacher. If teachers knew when their students were loosing focus and becoming uninterested in the lesson, they could change it to bring students back on focus, which would improve the productivity and use of time in the classroom because teachers would not be wasting time teaching students who are uninterested, and therefore, likely not listening. By eliminating this bordom factor, teachers would be more effective with their teaching time, and students would recieve a better quality of learning.

The technology could also help improve the quality of students' learning because it can make sure students are not confused. Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind. Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that ""'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually. Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost. The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs. It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it. This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning.

The quality of learning in a classroom setting could be improved by teachers knowing the emotions of their students, which would make new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System, valuable in a classroom setting. This technololgy would be beneficial because it could identify whether students are confused or bored, which would make class time more productive and interesting, as well as make sure all students understood the material. This would improve their quality of learning, and make school more meaningful.",0
"In today's society, most people believe that having a car is essential to everyday tasks. In their definition, everyday task can range from going food shopping to going to work in the morning. Some, on the other hand, consider everyday tasks to be checking in on friends just to showcase their new car. Although that may or may not be the mindset of many, people fail to realize there are other ways of reaching from point A to point B, without harming the environment and it's people. Limiting car usage not only benefits the person who is using the car, but their community and environment.

The use of a car isn't, at all, important in everyday use. Instead of using a car, which helps build up the problem of air pollution, one can simply walk, take a bike or even use public transportation. Just like Bogota, several countries should participate in a ""Carfree day"". Spreading awareness, that a car isn't always needed to move around an area, can help to benefit the people and the environment. As said in source 3, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"", bringing awareness of more easy and effective public transportation,which can help to rid that particular country of the usage of cars. Once participants of this carfree day understand the effects they are having upon the air pollution, they would be much more willing to help with this process just like businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Overall the usage of cars doesn't benefit the environment. Sooner, rather than later, it is important that we realize this problem and fix it before it's too late for our community.

Not only is the usage of a car terrible for our environment, it is also not needed as how it was. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005"", during this time, many vehicles were purchased with a high demand and were considered to be popular, although that isn't the case anymore. As years went past, the number of miles began to drop steadily. ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars"", that may be the case for some, but for others they didnt feel it was necessary to own one. In German Suburbs, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"", providing this area with no need for a car. Since everything was so near, a car was a waste of thought. If they did own cars, they would have to pay for both the car and a means of where to park the car. Those expensies were usually ""40,000, along with a home"", much more money than a free walk to any of your local stores. With the hopes of limiting the usage of cars, comes the need for expanding Vaubanlike suburbs. With that being said, according to the article, these suburbs need to be expanded ""not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are chocking cities"".

To sum it up, the limiting of cars is becoming important in the development of the new world and the fixation of the old. As of now, cars consist of having no benefit for the environment and of certain communities. As days go on and more people become aware of the means of public transportation, hopefully there won't need to be any cars. To take action in this plan, more Vaubanlike suburbs need to be put in place to give off the same react. Although some people understand the full effect of a car on the environment, it is critial that nearly every person understands. Cars, as of today's age, aren't benefiting the public as how they used to.",0
"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe she never talk about how she felt when the picture was took and people just say she was happy and she wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.",0
"The expcerpt ""The Challange of Exploring Venus"" brings up many unthought of ideas by just regular people who would just passivly think about the planet. The author explores many different reaons why venus would be a better planet to explore and learn much more about the interesting planet.

In the excerpt the author brings up many different points about why venus is a good planet to explore more and get more information on. His main idea is to study Venus to see what all is there because if the planet is earth like then it may have other things there that we have yet discovered about the planet. He supports his ideas in many ways by stating that Venus's environment is closest to earth.

At last the authors point may be questionable but at the end of the excerpt his says that Venus is not the main point its the idea of exploring something that may not have a big meaning but may led to larger things. Venus is only the beginning of what humanity can do for advancements in the human race.",0
"Dear state senator,

In reference to our state we would prefer keeping the electoral college instead of abolishing it. Under the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated three electors and treated like a state for pupose of the Electoral college. If you take this away, there will be anarchy all around us, and I assure you that you dont want this to happen.

The electoral college is a right for us, and it lets us know that we have a right, and a say in this country. It would be wrong to take that away from us.

What have Richard nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob dole, and the AFL-CIO all, in their own time, agreed on? They all agreed on abolishing the electoral college. And they are not the only one's who have said it. According to the gallup poll in 2000, shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral collge, won the popular vote but lost because of the 60% of his voters prefered a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.

I urge you to please consider your peoples feelings on this matter and consider not abolishing the electoral college.

Sincerly, a concerned citizen.",0
"Today we as a state take avantages of limiting  car usege.

"Decisions are a big deal but how do you know you are making the right decisions? others can help a lot by giving you advice but you also always need to make sure that you are talking to the right people and make sure they are giving the best advice to you.

Asking for advice is always a great idea if you are stuck with a decision.

first of all, you have a better chance of making the better decision when asking others for advice on your decision. When you only ask one person you only have one piece of advice but when you ask multiple people you have multiple ideas like if you ask three people fro advice and one person says one thing and then the other two have the same idea then you would go with the two people with the same idea because they have the advice that the majority agreed on. you also get way more support when asking multiple people because they all want to help out with the decisions you make. People will also push you to make the right decision when you are making big decisions like choosing your classes or what car you want to get.

Another big one is the people you talk to about your decisions. Teachers are really helpful when it comes to making the right choices because they are with you very often and are very nice and supportive. Parents, siblings, and other family members are also very good for your choices because they are always very supportive of you no matter what. Friends are another big one because they are your friends so they are always there for you no matter what, at school at home they always support you.

those two reasons are why asking multiple people for some help on choices is a smart thing to do.",0
"Dear state senator,

I beleive that we should throw out the electoral colledge and not use it anymore. Today it is irrelevant and it does not help out the elections, in fact I think it only causes trouble.

The electoral colledge is the last deciding factor of who acuatlly gets president. How is that a democracy? The people vote for who they want to in the main election and then by popular vote is usually what party gets to send the electors that would vote for them(source 1 ph 5-8). An example of this is the famous 2000 election. That election Al Gore and George Busch were facing off fo the right to hold office. Now Al Gore had won by popular vote, but instead what happened is the electoral colledge voted in favor of Busch instead of Al Gore(posner  ph16). So this shows that Gore should have won because he had the most votes by the american people, but then the electoral colledge voted someone else. So why did the people even vote if the person they wanted in office did not even make it in. That is why we should do away with the electoral colledge.

Now if for some reason the majority voted in a really crazy man into office that would completely corupt the government then it would be good too have something else that can change teh vote so that America does not get anymore corrupted. The only problem is how many times would you vote for a crazy person who you know will affect you in a very major way? My guess is not very often.

Now there is some perks but they are really only for the losing president. If the pesident did not win all of the popular vote he could have won a lot more swing states than his opponent which help him better in the electoral election(posner ph20). So there is only one way that the electoral colledge is helpful and it is not even to the American voters. This is why we need a change and to get rid of the electoral colledge.

So in conclusion, I have shared many reasons why the electoral colledge needs to go. I hope that you mull over these ideas and that you bring them to the governments attention.

Sincerely,

A student",0
"Since the rise of suburbs nationally and globally, car culture has been an important component of our history and of the typical human experience. Every teenager anticipates the excitement and freedom of a driver's license, our country is ""the birthplace of the Model T"" and ""the home of Detroit,"" and mothers across the globe rely on SUVs and station wagons to haul their children to and from school, soccer practice, Sunday mass, and the like Source 4. In recent years, however, there is a growing trend of limited car usage around the world as countries promote vehiclefree neighborhoods and as in nations like the USA, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39year olds getting a license,"" Source 4. This trend, while seemingly alarming in our technologydependent universe, offers several advantages, from a better environment to healthier citizens and communities, and encouraging and promoting this pattern may just be as revolutionary for the planet as the introduction of the first car over a century ago.

From France to Colombia, first of all, governments have been encouraging limited car usage as a means to better the environment through the reduction of toxic emissions into our atmosphere after all, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States,"" source 1. As debates have run rampant around the world about global warming and air pollution, several nations have taken initiative and experimented with the effects of this idea. In the district of Vauban, Germany, for instance, ""street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden,"" and as a result of expensive parking spots for those who do choose to operate their vehicles upwards of 40,000 a pop ""70% of vaughn's families do not own cars,"" Source 1. Limited car usage and public transportation is alternatively being promoted in Germany and elsewhere as an attempt to live our daytoday lives in a way that is healthier for ourselves and the planet. France is one such example in Paris, for instance, ""one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" ""nearrecord pollution"" led officials to impose a driving ban to help clear the air, and almost 4,000 were ticketed with a 31 fine as a result of not following orders Source 2. Free public transit was offered, and a result of the actions of the ruling party, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog,"" Source 2. Likewise, Bogota, Colombia annually hosts a program known as the Day Without Cars that has attracted interest from neighboring countries and cities and provides an opportunity to ""take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo, who spent the day bicycling with his wife source 3. Globally, limiting car usage has resulted in exciting changes for not only the environment, but, surprisingly, public health as well.

The obesity crisis and lack of healthy social interactions, secondly, both are looming global issues due the rise of supersized fast food and innovations in social media and the Internet, and this trend of limited car usage serves as an unseen, advantageous remedy by promoting healthier people and communities. Without cars, people must find alternative forms of transportation, and in Bogota, for example, during the Day Without Cars, ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated...to work,"" and since this campaign began in the mid1990s, it has seen ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and has resulted in parks, sports centers, and broad sidewalks considerably less traffic and the emergence of ""new restaurants and upscale shopping districts,"" Source 3. A mother of two in Vauban, Germany, Heidrun, Walter, claims that, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Source 1. Alternative forms of transportation also allow for increased social interaction walking with your neighbor on the way to work, your kids interacting while en route to school, or striking up a conversation with a stranger on a public bus or tram are all examples of making connections with others that do wonders for our mental and social health.",0
"Did you know that 26 percent of all motor vehicle crashes are related to the use of cell phones? Well, it's true! The level of danger related to the use of cell phones while driving is downright startling! The amount of distractions has drastically increased since the invention of cell phones. Not only do today's cell phones allow us to call, text, or chat at will, but they also give us access to hours of music and to interactive tools like GPS. Due to these capabilities, I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity.

Smartphones have always made it easy for us to stay connected, but that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his/her text messages, emails, phone calls, or social media platforms while driving. A driver can travel the distance of a football field in the time that it takes for them to answer one text message! According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, each day about 11 teenagers die in car crashes caused by texting while driving.

Car radios have always been a distraction to drivers, but the new advancements in smartphones gives us hours of music at our fingertips. We now can not only use music apps like Pandora or Spotify but we also can download endless amounts of music onto our smartphones. We can even use YouTube to listen to music videos! All of this music browsing not only distracts us from driving, but the volume level can also impair us from hearing approaching emergency vehicles traveling at high speeds.

Gone are the days of looking at paper maps. Today's cell phones all offer GPS to help drivers navigate in unknown areas. While this feature is very convenient and helpful, it can also lead to distractions while driving. Constant checking of the map on the screen to check where you are going keeps your eyes off of the actual road in front of you.

In conclusion, I feel that drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Even though today's cell phones offer us a lot of convenience, they also offer a lot of distractions. I hope with these bits of information, you'll make the right decision when you're on the road next. Answering that text message is not worth your life!",0
"No they shouldn't add an hour more because we don't need the hour but they should completely change the time for waking up and getting ready to come to school at 8 because i feel like every kid will have energy and not fall asleep.

also i think they should put each class an hour like example math should be an hour also Science , English , geography because all we honestly do need is come to school get our education then go home we dont need all stuff they put like electives they just make the day more longer and waste of our time honestly thats my opinion and how i see it.

they should only put the one hour in for the kids that need help or catch up with there missing work and that will help more for them because it would benefit them more but after all the day i think they shouldn't put that extra hour but like i said only if kids need help they should put the extra hour in.

after all they shouldn't make it an hour because its really not worth it if we already have a long day of school they should just take electives away so school can go more faster and just get it over it also just get our education faster.        ",0
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is unfair for voters all around the United States. The Electoral College is a Winner-take-all system in each state, the candidates don't spend time in the states that they know they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the tight races in the swing states. For example during the campaign in 2000, seventeen states did not see the candidates at all. Voters in the twenteyfive of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad!

Further more, ""voters vote for not the president, but a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.""  Voters cant always control who their electors vote for. The voters sometimes even get confused about the elector and vote for the wrong candidate. If you lived in Texas  and wanted to vote for Bob Smith (just an example), you'd vote for a slate of thirtyfour Democratic electors who are pledged to Bob Smith. If those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Bob would get 34 electoral votes toward his presidency. The electors can be anyone not holding a public office.

Did you know that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election more tham the kind of election we have now. According to the article "" a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after AI Gpre-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time, all aggreed on one thing, abolishing the Electoral College. This years voters can and will expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency, once again.

The best argument against the electoral college is called the disaster factor. Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows for worse. "" Consider that the state legislature are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" In 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with brand new elecors who would go against John F. Kennedy. Some faithless electors have even refused to vote for their party's candidate and instead they vote for whoever they want.

So its official now, the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational. The name makes no sense also why is it called the Electoral ""College""? The Electoral College should just be abolished like Bob Dole said.  So who is actually voting for the president? We the people? Or the Electoral College?",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author encourages humanity to rise up above the obstacles that have stopped us from exploring Venus in the past, and push forward into uncharted territory. He cites several reasons why humans might want to explore a planet with such harsh and unforgiving conditions, and he gives examples of solutions to the problems that these conditions cause. He uses compelling evidence and inspiring diction to support his claim that humanity should work towards exploring Venus. He supports this claim very well. One example of the evidence that he uses to support his claim is the fact that Venus bears many similarities to Earth, making it valuable in scientific reasearch. In paragraph four he writes: ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" He follows this up by explaining that gathering information about Venus could very well provide us with valuable information about our own planet; Earth. The author uses this evidence as the main reason that scientists would benefit from exploring the surface of Venus. One problem that the author encounters is the extremity of the conditions on Venus. However, he offers solutions to this problem later in the article, when he provides information on how NASA would combat the dangerous conditions on the surface and explore Venus without any harm coming to the people involved. In paragraph five he writes; ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian surface."" The author includes this example of a solution for the harsh conditions of Venus to compell the reader towards believing that exploring Venus would be a valuable use of time and effort for human civilization, due to the fact that it is not only rich with information that could help us explain our own lives on Earth, but also because on the surface of Venus could collect this information without having to risk the safety of the explorers that are involved. This is a powerful use of evidence, because it provides examples of why we should attempt to explore Venus, and it then works towards removing our doubt of this claim by giving us evidence that the risks that would be faced on Venus could be reduced significantly. In conclusion; the author's claim that humanity would benefit greatly from travelling to and exploring Venus is well supported, with both evidence that supports the idea that the information that we would gain would be valuable to us, and evidence that the risks that we would have to take would be small enough to ensure the safety of the people involved. The author inspires us to look beyond what we have at the moment and strive for a better future; one where we can become a multi-planetary civilization that has the ability to explore other planets and, perhaps, other stars.",0
"I've heard a great deal of conspiracieshaving to deal with the so called 'face' we at NASA found on Mars in '76. However, I would like to put these conspiracies to an end. When Viking 1 took the photo in 1976, I will admit it came as a kind if shock to us, we all soon figured it was nothing more than a common Martian mesa. And that's exactly what the 'face' was a common Martian mesa. The 'face' is simply a natrural landform; couldn't be any type of alien artifacts due to the following reasons: keeping alien life a secret would benefit NASA whatsoever, it was found in an area where Martian mesas are common, and we have recently taken photos with high-resolution to show that there aren't any buildings or other formations that could've been made by intelligent life.

Now most of you conspiracy theorists won't belive it, but I will explain how I got to this conclusion. The picture was taken around Cydonia, which is an area on Mars that Martian mesas are common to find. We've taken many pictures of these mesas around Cydonia to come to this conclusion.

Another reason the face on Mars is in fact a natural landform, is NASA hiding the fact that there is intelligent lifeforms on Mars wouldn't benefit NASA in any possible way. Finding life in the outer depths of space would be a tremendous accomplishment for NASA. Us finding liforms from entirely different planet would answer the biggest question of them all: Are we the only planet with life? If we'd found proof that we weren't alone we'd gain more funding for our space programs. with more funding we'd be closer to discovering more of the most unexplored area we know of: Space.

Finally, we have proof that it's only just a Martian mesa. Images taken in 2001 shows that there are no structures that could've been made by any intelligent lifeform.

Although the picture taken by Viking 1 didn't show us proof of life on Mars it did show us just how magnificent our universe really is. The 'face' on Mars was simply a natural landform made by nature itself. We have enough credible evidence to make the conclusion that the face on Mars isn't an alien landmark. artifact, or any sort of alien markings. We at NASA hope to one day find proof of other lifeforms in the deeper depths of space, but until then we will let the public know as of now we won't hid any information, such as the possibility of lifeforms from the public.",0
"The use of technology being able to read the emotional expressions of students is a little bit personal and invading someones privacy and their space just to see what they are actually feeling is pointless. I don't think that it is just to find out what someone is feeling if they don't want to tell you how they feel or don't want to be bothered then they should have that respect of not having to explain to everyone what's wrong. It would also divided people even more than they already are esspecially in schools, kids wouldn't hang out with each other if they had that type of technology to find out what someone else is feeling.

One reason for saying that emotional express reading is that it not the school job to tell a student, tell other students, or anybdy else what someone is feeling, besides possibly his or her parents being informed. My choice for saying that reason is that teachers, students, and people that aren't really associated with the person the are trying to read shouldn't have the elligability to read someone else's emotions. If they wanted to get to know the person they should do it naturally instead of seeing how they feel and then not wanting to be friends with them because maybe they are angry or depressed or what ever emotions that normlly others them from wanting to be frineds with someone or at least talking and having normal conversations.

My second reason for being opposed to the idea of using technology to find out what someone is feeling at the moment is that it's an invasion of privacy which is one of natural rights and not abiding by that natural right is essentually breaking the law. If someone doesn't want anyone to read their emotions then it should be left at that, but there are people that will push that boundry and do it anyway which isn't right.

My third and final reason for not agreeing with using technology to read emotions is that it divides people even more than they already are. If everyone was able to read someones emotions then everybody would know everone else with out knowing them, and what I mean by this is that they won't take the time to talk to them and get to know them but they will judge them on what technology says and will more than likely not like one of the emotions being read and possibly stay awaay or make fun of them because of it. Technology like that would keep apart and not really wanting to get up and visit people as much as it does now with smartphones and computers that have social media where people no longer have to go outside to visit their friends next door, they can just call them and not actually enjoy the outside and activities that come with it but will stay inside the house doing nothing but texting and calling.

To conclude my claim against the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a little bit personal and invading someones privacy and their space just to see what they are actually feeling is pointless. I don't think that it is just to find out what someone is feeling if they don't want to tell you how they feel or don't want to be bothered then they should have that respect of not having to explain to everyone what's wrong. It would also divided people even more than they already are esspecially in schools, kids wouldn't hang out with each other if they had that type of technology to find out what someone else is feeling.",0

"Venus is a planet in our Solar System, Venus gets often referred as the Earth's ""Twin"" due to the density, size and occasionally the closets in distance too. we will never realize or really understand the stuggles and experiments people have to go through just to visit Venus ."" Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

"In my opinion, the Facial Action Coding System is only telling what the faces are expressing not how the person is feeling. A person can be making one face but, can be feeling different. This technology couldn't be valuable to students in a classroom. The author states that Dr. Huang predicts, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" and then goes on to talk about how the computer would modify the lessons for the student. The computer could suggest the student is feeling one emotion but the student could really be feeling another. A student could be mad and irritated but the computer could suggest it is confused by the facial expressions the student is showing. A student could look tired but, could be feeling happy and the computer could suggest that the student is sad and miserable when in reality the student is just tired.

The article also states that Dr. Paul Eckman is using six basic emotions; happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. There are many more emotions that just these six, so when the computer is trying to calculate a facial expression it could be way off from how the student is really feeling since it is only using six basic emotions.

In my opinion, no, The Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable for students in a classroom. The system has only six basic emotions, which a student could be feeling none of. People don't know what another person is feeling by only looking at their facial expression. I don't agree that The Facial Action Coding System could know what a person is feeling just by seeing a facial expression especially if a human can't and I don't believe this system could be of any valuable use for a student in a classroom.",0
"Students can feel various different types of emotions throughout the school day. School can be very stressful and overwhelming yet so enjoyable at the same time. When students are feeling a certain way, it may affect their ablity to learn. By incorporating the use of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom, teachers or even the computers themsleves could alter the learning style of the information being taught, making it customized and fitting for a specific student based on their emotions.

Everyone is different when it comes to learning. Some students may be visual learners where as some students may be auditory learners. There are numerous, unique differences spanning from individual to indivdual which makes it hard on teachers when trying to teach a group of students the same material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System would make the job easier on teachers and prove helpful for students. For example, if a teacher could not visually recognize that one of thier students was tired, they may continue on with the way they are teaching the information, and that particular student may not grasp the concept being taught. With the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would be able to recognize the students emotions and would have the opprotunity to alter her teaching method to somehting more engaging for the student. This would also prove helpful for the student that was feeling tired becasue they would now be able to become engaged with a modified style of learning.

If the Facial Action Coding System recognized that the students appeared to be happy and engaged, this could guide the teacher to continue teaching in that particular style and it would benefit the students trying to learn. Another way that this new technology could prove valuble in the classroom is if students were doing work on their computer or other elctronic device. If the Facial Action Coding System was installed into the learning devices that the students are using, the device itself could alter the learning style of the information given to fit the students needs. Even Dr. Haung, a professor at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Huang).

The Facial Action Coding System would prove to be valube and helpful in many ways when incorporated in the classroom. The use of this technology would allow teachers and electronic teaching devices to enhance their learning styles to attend to all different types of students. Often times teachers forget that some individuals learn differently than others and only focus thier course in one direction. This new form of technology could serve as a reminder to teachers that students vary in learning styles but could also account for those differences among students.",0
"Dear Senator,

I think that Electoral College is not the way to vote in the future. We should make a change in our goverment and make elections by popular vote. For these reasons we should make changes. We don't know who the electors vote for. The Electoral College is unfair. Popular vote is more accurate.

If we are going to have Electoral College lets at least know who our elector votes for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" By this I mean, not letting him choose who ever he's going for. As in of showing that he took everyones vote and made them all count. Even if the guy he's going for wins the election, we can say it was fair.

The Electoral College is not fair. First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.

Popular vote is more accurate. By me saying this is that everyones vote counts. There's no electors invovled causing you to fall in doubt. Even though it says that Electoral College electors ""...that trust is rarerly betrayed."" I still think that the people will cofide more in popular vote showing them that they didn't just vote for no reason.

Electoral college is getting more and more complicated causing people to doubt. We should change because we don't  know who the electors vote for. The Electoral College is unfair. Also because popular votes are more accurate. Electoral College is irrational and not accurate.",0
"The electoral college is a time worn system. Some people hate it, others defend it to their dying breath. The electoral college is no longer a good way to select our nations' leader because the power no longer rests with the people.

Through the electoral college system, we put our votes into the trust of strangers who may or may not decide to vote how they want and completely disregard our voices. Plus with all of the corruption in government as it is, it wouldn't be the most difficult thing to buy a voter off and potentially change the outcome of the election. Or the electoral college voters could end up clueless or untrustworthy, as Bradford Plumer, Source 2, paragraph 10, points out: ""Can voters always control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."", proving the point that the people are not in control.

Granted there are a few small benefits to the electoral college. It usually prevents the confusion of ties inside states, and, as Source 3, paragragh 20, Richard A. Posner says, "" Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""

The problem with the overwhelming power given to the swing states by the electoral college is that it does not represent the American idea: that no one group of people is in control, that everybody has an equal say in the matter. When a state like California votes for a candidate, that candidate immediately has an advantage from the start. And all the people in California who voted for the other candidate are not heard at all.

Corruption is, again, a major problem with most politics, including the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists nearly replaced all of the democratic electoral voters in Louisiana with voters who would instead oppose John F. Kennedy, and potentially cost him the election. But while a small group of people can be bought off and turned to vote against the majority, it is impossible to corrupt the American people. It would also cause candidates to have to pay more attention to the smaller states and the states that the candidate thinks they will win over automatically due to their current party.

The American people need the power to elect their leader back in their hands again. The electoral college was a good system years ago, but with time comes change.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents to humans that even get near the planet. Even with the dangers that are poised against those who would go near Venus, there is still intrigue in the planet from our simple human nature, the opporatunity of studing an Earth like planet besides our own, and the fact that Venus is so close to Earth.

The main reason of studying the planet Venus is capitalized by the article and the author in this quote ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" The Author also simply puts in the article that humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus all unmanned.

Another reason for the intrigue in studing Venus is our simple human nature. In another quote by the author and in the article ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense. The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like.

The author suggested studying Venus would be a wirthy pursuit despite the dangers. I say they actually supported their idea thoroughly in the end. There also seems to be no error in the logic of the author either.",0
"Every four years there is an election. The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years. The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections. The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use. On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President. While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote.

The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results. One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal. This is crucial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" Posner. With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them. Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes. It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" Posner. Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory. Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal.

Again, the popular vote will be more fair. It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win. In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes. This happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency Plumer. The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates. If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them. The Electoral College is also not fair because if there is a tie, then the vote goes to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives' ""selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"" Plumer. The majority of the House of Representatives is Republicans, so the president elected will be reflected by that, and it will not give the Democrats equal representation. All in all, popular vote should be used to determine the President because it is a more fair and an equal way to do so.

Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign. With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states."" They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote. In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited. Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina Plumer. Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision. Also, with the Electoral College people in states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention to the campaign. A person such as, a ""Republican in California... have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"" Posner. Everyones opinion should matter and should be taken into account when electing the President. To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters.

In conclusion, electing the President is a painstaking task and should be done using popular vote, not the Electoral College. The President of the United States plays an important role in our country. The President has to make many difficult decisions, and those decisions should be a reflection of the entire country. It should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote.",0
"Is driving a car really that crucial? Do people really need their own personal means of transportation? Around the world people are limiting their usage of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage are lower pollution, you can decrease your expenses by not having to pay a car payment or insurance, and many people have started to limit car usage so you dont have to worry about standing out socially.

Pollution is a big issue when it comes to driving because cars cause a lot of pollution. In Paris a partial driving ban has been passed to try and clear the smog out of the city. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day"" Duffer 11. 4,000 people were fined but congestion was down 60 percent. This was done because paris has more smog than other European capitals. Smog is not the only reason you should limit your car use if you dont have a car at all you are probably saving a lot of money.

If you limit your car use to the point where you dont even own a car you can save a lot of money. You wouldn't have to pay your car payment and you wouldn't have to pay for insurance either. The downside of this is you would have to rely on other means of transportation and it would be hard to if you lived in a large city. If you lived in Vauban Germany however, you could bet away without a car. "" While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs.... Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life"" Rosenthal 6. In this suburban area people have given up their cars and turned to ""smart planning"". Some people are not worried about the money or pollution involed but are more concerned about they will be accepted socially.

Social acceptance is what holds some people back from limiting car use. Even for those people limiting car use will not be a problem because in the united states car use has declined. ""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily there after"" Rosenthal 32. This means that either Americans are going to keep steadily declining from using cars or this is just the younger generation and once they grow up they will have to get cars to go about their routines as adults.

The main reasons for limiting car usage are lower pollution, not spending as much money, and not having to worry about social acceptance. It is for these reasons that limiting car use is not only good but it is an advantage.",0
"To you, a car may mean no more than just getting from point A to point B. Cars play a much bigger impact than it may seem. They affect not only the person driving, but the people around it. They also have a negative impact on the greenhouse gases. So riding a bicycle to work one day, won't just be good for you, it will also be good for the environment around you.

Cars have become a universal item. A lot of people have them, but no really gives them much thought. There are a few places that have spent the time and really developed ways to keep a community clean without the hazardous fumes coming from the car exhaust. For example, Vauban, Germany has developed a system where cars are banned. The only place you can keep your car is on the outskirts of town in designated garages. Due to this, most people dont even have a car, and have chosen to sell it before moving in. In Bogota, Columbia they had a developed a day free of cars where anyone that drove a car would have to pay a fine. According to the governer it was a amazing thing and everyone was participating in it. This also helped get some the nasty gases that they produce away.

Cars give of hazardous gases threw their exhaust. These gases will rise and get caught in the ozone. Which impacts the environment greatly in more ways than one. It can cause the air your breathing to be toxic. It also is one of the main reasons for ""Global Warming"". Paris learned this the hard when they reached a record level pollution. They decided they had no choice but to ban half the cars one day and ban the other half the next day. After this the congestion was down 60%, proving that it has helped greatly. Just imagine if one day instead of driving you could ride a bike and help change the environment.

Places have tried to develop ways to reduce the levels or gases. Some have been very succesful, for example, in Bogota and Vauban they have found creative ways to help. The question is whether or not cars should be done with all together. To that i'd have to say no, cars play a big part in getting to work on time or traveling. Taking cars away would mean taking away family trips and other fun things to do with cars. The real answer to the question is that cars should not become so much of a necessity. There should be ways for people to get around better without the use of cars. Now what that might be, the future has yet to tell.",0
"The face is fake. there is a lot of evadence that the face is fake. for one,in all three pictures it looks different. also the"" face"" it not even simular to a face. it also says that the camra had to look close to get a pic.

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes a new technology that allows computers to identify human emotions. The author also describes how this new technology can read the expressions of students in a classroom. This seems like an extremely valuable peice of technology. There are many ways that this can help students with there education. This technology can help students understand what they are learning better, which can result in a better education.

For example, this technology can help a student that is having difficulty on a lesson they are learning just by identifying there emotions. In paragraph six of the article it states, that a class computer can identify when a student is becoming bored or if the student is having trouble understanding the material, then the technology can change up the lesson so that the student does not get bored or confused. This results in a better education for students. With this type of technology students will be more educated and that will help future generations to come.

In the article, the author describes to us, this new technology, Facial Action Coding System, which can identify human emotions. This is indeed valuable to students in classrooms. This tech can read students emotions and modify the lesson, so that the student understands the material. the Facial Action Cosing System will soon be essential for learning in the future so that students can be more educated for when they are out in the real world. With this tech students will soon have an education that is right for them.",0
"I think the Electoral College should stay, because even if its ""indefensible"", ""corrupt"", ""Despised"" the Electoral College has its outcomes Big States, RunOffs and Presidential desputes. Its a process, Are own founding fathers who where enlightment thinkers, who thought more then what was written on the script. They thought outside the box, they wanted to know the ""why"" and how it will affect and how to bring this nation to its highest. Placing it in the constitution, knowing this method will do justice on future on elections. Its one of the best laid method in the world and removing it will just imbalance everything.

In the United States, each states has a majority and majority. Where people consist the most is by the coast, west and east. Its in are human nature, its been around for ages that humans live more on coastal or river areas. Any area where it consist of water,Harbor and trading routes. They receive the most of products around the world, and maintain abandons of humans. So the bigger states are California, Florida, NY, Virgina, Texas and etc. The electoral votes restores the balance. In campaigns propaganda is used alot. commercials, ads, anything they can publish themselves to show and persuade the people in elections. larger states gets more attention from presidential candidates then smaller states. Smaller states in the middle of the U.S consist of small populations so with electoral votes the weight using the population census lose by the virtue of malAppointment of the senate. Its all about propaganda that presidential campaigners use to get the big states attention cuase that where the points are at.

Electoral College avoids problem with runoffs in which no candidate receives a majority vote cast, which is the popular vote. Presidential desputes occur when a campaigner manipulates the people with spitting out promises in Propaganda ads, winning the popular vote. But with electoral college, you have a second chance to look closely on whats happening. With electoral college and electing a president you need a system. If the majority of the states and senate are republican and the president is a democrate the two partys arnt gonna agree on anything. Desputes will occure and in 4 years the country will accomplish nothing. With electoral college theres a balance of votes, each states gets there political party they voted on and it evens out when the day comes. Voting is important cuase your choosing whos gonna lead your country for the next four years and electoral college opens up many doors that will help you analysis better in whats occuring and your setting up your country system.

The electoral college may have its problem buts a system that will carry out the nation longer without many torubles then without it. Are founding fathers knew what they where doing, they thought big the U.S and look where the U.S is now. One of the strongest nation in the world, thanks to the system they created and left us.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents .Why wouldn't it be worthy to study about Venus when its the closest planet to Earth & Venus was probably just like Earth.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because who wouldn't want to learn more about other planets like Venus, the cloeset planet to Earth, we have new techology to be able to study more about whats out there than Earth, Moon, or the Sun. In the texts says ""Venus was probabaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Venus and other planets are a worthy pursuit to be able to study because if we soon learn way more about Venus, there could be life on Venus, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment that includes familiar features such as vallys, moutains, and craters."" Venus and Earth both have rocky sediment or moutains and craters, Erath & Venus could be the same, despiting the dangers there is.

Although, in the text says "" NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" Sending humans from Earth to study is worthy because we can now tell if there is still water and a living place for humans. Even though the temperatures are dangerous for us humans to be living in 170 degress fahrenheit ""the air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. Solar power woulf be plentiful, the radiation would not exceed Earth levels, Not easy condition's, but survivable for humans."" states the author, we shouldn't be leaving any chances to not study more on Venus, if there could possibly life there. Or myabe there can't be life on venus because of the dangers there is for us humans, we should still learn and find out more on how could there be life on Venus.

In ""The Chanllenge of Exploring Venus,"" the aurthor suggestd that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,and i agree because it is worthy to find out new things outside of Earth and other planets that can have life on, such as Venus, it's a good idea to study and learn more about the planets orbiting around us.",0
"umm, maybe we can settle downoff the cars !!, i beleive that can be an good idea for citizens in the united states without cars this can be a better world for me and people in my community and my city , this can help reduce the amount of air pollution from cars and  from other automobiles ,another way  we can decrease the use of cars is by having a car-free week. these ways can make a big change in the way people use cars  in thisx culture.

the reduce in car usage can help people from getting sick from trucks and cars from polluting the air, not only can people get sick but animals such as,dogs cats and some farm animals wat humans eat. the pollution in the air can cause plants to  die what farm animals feed on,for example where i live i saw an horse suffering from  dead plants. also, car pollution  can sometimes cause crashes because of all the smoke from an bad engine or even car that fan can be over heated, for instance one time i was on my way to walmart on a very hot day , all of a  sudden smoke started coming from my mom smoke pipe under the car, the cause of this was because her fan was over heated. there can be many ways an car can cause  pollution in the air thats why we need to slow down on  the car population or usage a day.

air pollution can be a major way fror the president to pass an law about car usage. but,  another way to stop people from using there cars. are by having an week off from cars and big trucks,if we have an week off from cars  more people  would be walking more or riding bicycles. for example, according to the seattle times in the city of bogota  people had less stress from being jammed up in traffic and lower air pollution. ,moreover, this can help because it can slow down the amount of fuel people use in a day. just imagine one week without cars this people can be able to catch the bus instead of driving. without cars people could slive better.",0
"Why drivers should not access their phones while driving

Majority of the population today are glued to their phones more and more every day or either own one. The problem is, we can never put them down when convenient. This is much of a safety hazard, especially if we are driving. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, because it is a very dangerous task, drivers are more likely to be the cause of the accident, and it can be very costly for some.

People do not think of it as much, but they are putting many lives at risk. Reasons why people should not have their phones on person while driving a vehicle is because it is a real life safety hazard on the road for you and others. Drivers can get easily distracted by what is on their phone, and are far more likely to get in an accident with another driver or swerve off the road. Which leads to confrontation with the driver that was hit and when incidents like these happen, people do not survive. Studies show that distracted drivers on their phones caused twenty-six percent of car accidents in 2014 and text messaging five percent. Any time the driver is distracted with a cell phone in hand, they are driving dangerously and are risking other lives on the road as well as their own. So holding a phone to talk or scrolling through social media means that one hand is off the wheel, which greatly reduces the driver's control of the vehicle. Studies also show that using a phone while driving means that the driver's eyes and focus are now on the completing task with the phone instead of the road. If someone needs to brake, avoid, or use their horn to alert another driver about something, they may not have enough time because they were not paying attention. Intoxication is one reason but distracted driving will always be number one according to researchers. More and more people need to be more considerate from pedestrians to other drivers at risk.

While taking a phone call or text is dangerous enough, those drivers are more likely to be the cause of the accident. This is not good on the driver that caused it nor the other driver. As to whoever is driving the vehicle is on their phone, their eyes automatically start to drift off and cause the accident. According to daily news, younger Americans are much more likely to have been arrested than previous generations because of them being on their phones while driving. It also states that Americans under the age of 26 are much more likely to be arrested for being on their phones while driving and causing an accident. With the increase in arrest rates, this occurs more rapidly among white Americans, women, and teens. It is known that the fine in Georgia, while texting and driving, is one-hundred fifty dollars and it also carries one point on your driving record which may result in higher insurance or even cancellation. As this is a well known problem, there is a solution. More and more states are trying to pass a law as to where Americans can use hands-free technology when they want to have access to a phone call. Such as using Bluetooth headphones, so drivers do not have to take their eyes off the road and be the cause of the accidents that occur overtime.

Not everyone likes to pay for expensive things such as taxes, bills, fixing things that have broken in your house, etc. So having to pay insurance for somebody else's car and your car, is something I do not think anybody would want to go through in any point of their lifetime. To avoid those mishaps, it is best that drivers stay off their phones while driving a vehicle. According to researchers, on average, most car accident settlements range between fourteen thousand and twenty-eight thousand dollars depending on the accident. So imagine have to pay that much money because somebody decided to look down at their phone, and cause an accident. Thinking about that can have people think twice about not wanting to look at their phones while driving. Sometimes it does not change all of people's minds, and people still continue to make that terrible decision.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving because it many problems that we do not need. We do not always have to have our phones, there is plenty of time to wait. So I think people should think twice before they pull out their phone while driving.",0
"Many people prefer to work in a group, because they think it can be more helpful, and others people said that they prefer to work alone. There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group.

When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster.

Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily.

In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas.

Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster.

In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own. ",0
"The temperature in Venus is over 800 degress, and the atmosphere is 900 times greater than what we have in Earth. The temperature in Venus is dangerous for people to visit. It can cause death or other bad symptoms for your body. Other than all the dangerous things that Venus can cause, is that Venus is the most alike planet. Venus used to be only coverd in oceans. Venus is one of the best planets. Mercury is very close to the sun but it's not the hottest planet, and Venus is not close to the sun but it still has a very high temperature. Both planets are beautiful to visit and also are beautiful to look at. Venus still has those feautures where it kinda look like Earth's feautures. It just looks like it has rocky mountains, and greyish but still looks pretty to look at. If you are planning to visit Venus, you can not step into the planet and feel it. The best way to avoid dangerous situations is looking only at the planet. The air pressure is similar to Earth. On paragraph 3 it says ""These conditions are far extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" and on paragraph 5 it say's ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degress fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

"The advantages of limiting car usage is a good thing because some people might feel stress out when they are behind the wheel but thanks to the limitied  usage of cars people can just walk and keep a calm mind and stress free. Also there would be more space becaues the car garge can used for somthing else like making stores. Then there will be less greenhouse gas. then we will more money. Finaly that is some advantages of limiting car usage.

One advantages of limiting car usage is the lack of tense or stress you will feel when you are walking instead of driving. When you are driving you feel so stressed out because you are nervues that you might hit some or might crash on the side of the road. Then you will have more of your time instead of rushing to get some were you will feel calm chilled and relaxed becaues you are walking the stress away. Next you will be able to spend more time with your friends and talk to them more instead of texting them and get in a reck. finaly that is my advantage of limiting car usage.

Second reason why is do to the lack of parking lots garages there will be more space for something more need a hospiltle or a store for food. Then we will have space for more homes so it will cut down the amout of homless people on the street. Also the lack of parking will help decress the amout of death in some because there will be less people starving on the streets. Then there will be spaces for resetraunts,fast food,and other places were people can work at so there will be more jobs avaiable. Finaly that is another advantage in the lack of car usage.

Third reason is there will be less greenhouse gases in the air. Then do to the lack of greenhouse gases there will be less polution in the air causing people not to get sick. Then do to the lack of polution the will survie longer and our omdoem layer will start to repair it self. Then we will be able to breath better and live longer. finaly that is another advantage of limiting car usage.

Inconlusion that are just a few possabilty's do to the lack of car usage's. One you will be less tense. Two more space for important places. Three the lack of greenhouse gas. That are noly just some advantages maybe there will might be more i the futer.",0
"The presidential Elections.

The elections are a brutal time candidates compete for the favor of the citizens they campaign, give great speeches about why they would be best for the position of leading the nation, often state why their adversary would be the worst person for the job. This causes opposition in the nation tearing it apart, however now not only are the people emotional about the election but also about the process, their are aguments about whether or not that the original process would remain. The system that the elections have been held since the Constitution has been written was that each citizen in a state would vote for one candidate or the other by voting for the electors of that specific person then the electors in turn would vote for the candidate and their votes would decide the presidency as stated in paragraph six and seven of the first source"" What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register. This system although it has worked so far it is not the best way of conducting the elections in this time and age citizens should modify and conform the process to fit the need we have now.

The problems claimed by the ones poised to the electoral college, as told in the second source "" The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, are that the process cause individuals to have little to no say in the person that will be their leader for years, they do not have control over who their candidates elect and must simply hope that they do indeed vote for who they promised to, also the election is decided by the few states that do not have a predetermined majority of voters in each state leaving the rest of the country feeling left out of the fiasco of the election and as if their perfered candidate dose not care of them or their support and opinions. This presents the system to be truly flawed in the way that it is currently operating.

Individuals,as source three ""In Defense of the electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, wish to claim that the system is not flawed in great lengths because it has worked for such a time that it is seen by them sufficient in its orcastration. It is said that the electors often do vote for who they pleaged they would and that decite is uncommon: however why should America risk the possibility of decite it has happened befor and if not prevented it will happen again. Do we not owe it to ourselves, posterity, and country to fix all potental harms to our nation the presidency should not be taken lightly it is a grand position that gives power and fame to all who hold those who have it could maintain the country, grace the nation with new prosperity, or condem Americans to years of suffering, toil, and misery. As citizens we should not alow anyone but the most valid character obtain this place. Mistakes are not alowed! we should take it upon ourselves now to modify this method be for it is to late and avertid.

There is no mitake America must act fast and modify this method for the nation, for their children, and for themselves.",0
"Why should the people of the united states vote if the electoral votes are the onlt ones that count? I feel it should be up to the people of the united states not all up to the electors. Even though most people know the people are actullay voting for the slate of electors when i feel we as the people of the united states that are votes should count we shouldnt have to depend on someone else.

Even though if the electors tie and then the peoples votes count it would be fair but we be able to fight for are country  at the age eighteen and be able to  vote but still not count is unfair because that would then be the boss of are country and are troops. Also they can leave us to fight over seas and defend are country but we have electors who stay in th u. s all there life and get to chose who run the untied states.

Also, it sates the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It should not be are votes through another person we dont know. For an example that would be like giving a stranger three-thousand dollors and telling it to mail it to one of your family members its a fifty-fifty chance its going to actully get to them.

I just feel that are votes should matter more then electoral votes we get harmed by what ever the president does not any of the electorals.

"Deer Senator:

They should keep the Electoral college, Because its where people vote to choose who's going to be the president and the vice president.

The State conventions, the presidential candidates, the state party's central committee they all should vote or choose at the same time. Voters get confused because the state convention, presidential candidates and the state central committee don't make up their minds....Why American people should considere themselves lucky if that was Back in 1960's, what makes them so sure that American people are going to be lucky again? well they might get lucky this time but not always they're going to be lucky every year its difficult and we are in 2015 now.

People should STOP thinking about what happen in the 1960's it might happen again okay but that was 45 years ago. Why A catastrophe? why cant they live in peace and stop hatting or whatever's going on.

If they keep doing that it might be a fight or a war between them, and we dont want any fights or wars this year. The electoral college have to change for good if they dont they wont see any votes when its time to vote..Segregationists they have to stop being rasists because people from all over the world are voting for them and they are all from different races.

"Dear state senator,

I believe we should change the election process. You should change it to an election of popular vote and give the people power to decide not on the electors for the candidates, but just on the candidates themselves. It would be a much easier process, and at the same time, a much less expensive way of electing presidents.

There was a Gallup poll in 2000 that even states that 60% of the population of voters prefered a direct election instead of using the electoral college. That year, Al Gore won the popular vote, but, thanks to the electoral college, he lost the presidency.

Also, the electoral college is an unreliable way to elect the president because the people can't know for sure who chose the electors. Anyone could have chosen them!

This is why we should change the election process to an election of popular vote and  let the people decide on the candidates themselves. It would save money by not having so many people in the electoral college to pay and it would be a much easier and fair process.",0
"Phones and Driving

Over the last few years there have been many records of death and/or Injury from being on your phone and driving. There are many laws in place to stop this act from happening, but just like with everything else, there's no way to fully stop it. Many people have different opinions on the subject. In this essay I will be explaining the two sides; good and the bad. How dangerous is it to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time?

Six thousand people die each year in the US due to texting and driving. Cell phone use should be prohibited why you operate any piece of machinery. Things malfunction and can go wrong with your full attention on them. Don't give any room for error. You aren't only putting yourself into danger but everyone else around you as well. Anything you do besides watching the road and focusing on your surroundings is putting your life at risk. Anything can happen in two seconds without your eyes on the road. Think about how many times you almost got into an accident due to someone else not paying attention, but you're fine because you were. A phone takes that away from you.

There's not a good side to texting and driving. They've made many alternatives to not having to touch your phone while driving but still being able to operate it. We all have a virtual human on our phones who tells us directions or calls who we want based on us saying things like, ""Hey Siri."" They make phone holders for your dash, but that's sill dangerous because you shouldn't take your eyes off the road anytime the vehicle is in motion. Everyone uses a cellphone while driving because they feel like they must be in a rush to get a text sent or etc. It isn't safe to be distracted by anything while driving let alone something so addicting already like a cellphone.

In conclusion, trying to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time is dangerous and life threatening. It takes one second to not be in an accident because you were too late. Just one second could change so many lives, and impact many more. You should stay focused on the road and arriving to your destination. That one missed phone call can be returned, and if not pull over somewhere safely and stay parked until you're done messing with your phone. Don't operate a phone and drive. The road requires your full attention.",0
"I do agree, attitude is energy, and without energy we are nothing.

All the time, the attitude of every single person could change radically, but that could demonstrate what kind of person who you are. Every single person who can not do their own things with attitude, is like if they're not doing it with energy.

My mom change radically her attitude when she's talking with an unknown person. My cousin is the one that teach me how to be a better person just with attitude,

because of some problem's that we have in our family, for all the things that happen in my country, and also for the death of my uncle.

I love my big brother, I want to be as him, for the things he achievement on all his life. My brother is one of the most kindness person in the world. He could talk with an angry person, and just a few minutes, he would be able to change they're mind, how can that be possible?. Its all about attitude.

It's been a while for all the moment's that I lived in my entire life. Every single night that I'm going to sleep, I think all about what I did during the whole day, and I go over to think what do I did wrong, and what do I have to change to have a awesome personality, so when people talk to me, just for the way I talk, they would know if I have a great attitude. The attitude can help people life, because when you are going to ask for a application to get an employment, if you are thinking negative things, nothing is going to be positive to you.",0
"Why would you seek multiple opinions? Seeking multiple opinions is a good idea for multiple reasons. I think people should ask for numerous opinions because you can learn from someone else mistakes, someone might have already been in the same situation, and everyone has different opinions from different point of views

Asking for opinions from many different people is a good idea. I think you should always seek the advice of others. One reason I would ask for multiple opinions is because you can learn from their mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and there is no reason that you shouldn't want to lean from them. Be brave, be bold, live life, make your own mistakes, learn from them along the way, but don't forget to seek advice. How often do you seek advice from others? I ask for peoples opinions all the time. There are a lot of people out in the world that have been in your situation weather its a good situation or a bad situation. Don't be afraid to ask for someone s opinion especially if it is about something that means a lot to you. If something you are scared of is keeping you from making the right decision then seek advice.

How many people do you know with their own opinion? Everyone you know has an opinion of their own. Some opinions are nice, but everyone sees things from a different point of view. Just because you see something differently from someone else doesn't mean either one of you are wrong. If someone gives you their advice, and you are having a hard time understanding why they think that, then find someone else and ask them for their advice, because everyone has a different point of view on things.

You have your own opinion. We all have our own opinion. In conclusion I think that asking someone for their advice is a great idea. Learn from peoples mistakes, and make your mistakes along the way. Don't be scared to seek advice, because you are not the only one in your situation. Everyone has different opinions from different point of views. Just because you don't see things like someone else doesn't mean either one of you are wrong.",0
"This program is helpful for younger students because it would get work accomplished with the presence of the older student. Older students that volunteer helping younger students would make younger students feel more at ease. Younger students won't have to deal with their assignments being due because they already turned it in. This program will help younger students study with assistance by the older students to get a high grade in tests or quiz. Older and younger students can play board games or read a book to help them get better with their English and writing skills.

Play outside basketball, soccer, football, etc just to have fun and waste that energy. Younger students who want to pick sports is fine as well, Older students can support or encourage younger students to do what they want. Older students can review things in the year for younger students to remember the key things or notes for the SOL's. Then younger students won't have to fail the SOL because they have the knowledge to surpass the test. Younger students with knowledge can get past Elementary, Middle, and High school and get that degree to College leading them to jobs they need or want in the future.         ",0
"Today majority of humans own or use a cell phone.

Most people may use it on a daily basis, when they at work, school, and home.

People nowadays can't live without their phones. However, having a phone nowadays can be huge distraction to humans.

People shouldn't operate phones while driving a vehicle because it can injury them, others thats driving.

Driving can be very dangerous, when anyone's driving they have to drive for themselves and others. Driving can seriously kill someone so being on your phone while driving can be even worse. No matter if it's a text, injuring someone or killing someone is more important . People can check their phone if they stop somewhere , not while driving. Humans nowadays can't live without their phones.

Majority of humans use their phone everyday and this may be a huge distraction while driving. Maybe like 80%

of people are distracted while driving. They may not understand how serious it is driving while being on your phone can not only injury others but you can be in bad shape to. A phone notification is not worth taking someone's life or injuring someone. It's other ways people can check their phone notification.

Things people can do to prevent them from getting in a accident while being on their phone while driving. They can use a google voice device to help send messages. Also they can bluetooth their phone to their car to answer calls. This can be a big help and much safer for drivers. Most people would be less distracted now.

Overall, people should not operate their phones while driving. A cell phone notification is not that important than driving on the road. Anyone can be seriously injury by cell phone distraction so therefore it's not safe. It can be safer ways people can see their phone nonfiction. Driving can be much safer without operating a phone.",0
"Have you ever seen a smog cloud before? Or even been a city that has a really high level of it? It's typically caused by the vehicles, and how much that they're used in the area that you happened to be in. There are some places that have days where your not aloud to drive. There are some places that people don't even own cars, and places where people only go by bus, bike, car pooling, or train. But there is one thing we notice about all of these people, and the places that they live in when they have people consistently going by other means, and not using their car. It's been a problem that has been up in the air for the longest time, and people are starting to do something about it, and probably without even knowing it.

The city of Vauban, Germany is pretty normal. it consist of normal homes, normal people, and just normal everyday life. Except for two things. ""vaughn's streets are completely ""carfree""except the main thoroughfare"" paragraph 2, Source 1. Even if you owned a car, ""there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for fortythousand dollars, along with a home"" paragraph 2, Source 1. The other crazy thing about this town is that Vauban is ""home to five thousandfive hundred residents within a rectangular square mile "" paragraph 6, Source 1. Their town is free of the green house emissions that are caused by passanger cars. It's there way of smart planning, and other cities are starting to try to find ways to become cleaner, and better at being somehow like Vauban. People here say that it reduces the stress of driving, and traffic jams, and makes life simply easier by not driving. But imagine if you were banned from driving in a place where you were used to driving everyday.

Paris decided that ""after days of nearrecord pollution, they would enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" paragraph 10, Source 2. some 4,000 drivers were given a fine of thirtyone dollars, and there were twentyseven cars impounded due to disobeying the ban. however, after 5 days of this ban going in to effect, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of france"" paragraph 14, Source 2. The people driving isn't really the problem, it's the fact that ""France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline"" paragraph 16, Source 2 and they're saying that becuase it makes up such a higher percentage of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that it's causing their smog levels to go up higher as well. Gradually the smog lifted off of the city of paris, and they were finally able to start letting certain amounts of cars back on the road without fines. There are some places that they have days that are car free?

In the LatinAmerican city of Bogota, they have a day that's carfree. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work"" paragraph 20, Source 3. They only face a small fine of twentyfive bucks if they decide to drive, but msot people don't have to worry if they don't have a bike or don't want to walk. Buses and taxis are still aloud on the roads. Even on the days where ""gray clouds dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota, the rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" paragraph 2223, Source 3. It's not just 5,500 people who don't do it, there are seven million people in the capital city who don't drive. It's been going on since the 1990s. The city has planned, and made efforts to have these days so that they can also take part in the reductin of the emiisions of green house gases. ""The city has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths and uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth ones"" paragraph 2728, Source 3. Many places are trying to encorporate designs in to their cities to do these things, and to become better at traveling in means other than your personal vehicle. but even without our knowledge, people are starting to limit car usage without being told to, it's just inch by inch.

People are beggingin to drive less, and ""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"" paragraph 32, Source 4. however in the past few years, americans have bught fewer cars, and ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has dropped steadily therafter"" paragraph 32, Source 4. reseachers are intrigued that car ownership per household had gone down, three to four years before they noticed this. This pattern continuing, which they believe it will, would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"" paragraph 34, Source 4. Other odd things have changed too. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of sixteen to thirtynine year olds gettign a license. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased twentythree percent between 20012009"" paragraph 41, Source 4. Plans are being put in action to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and to put more ways into cities for people to travel alternatively to their normal going by car. The way that we're building cities, new suburbs, and things like that are beginning to incorporate other ideas from around the world to help not just everyone including yourself, but also the enviroment itself.

Meeting new people really isn't all that bad, and traveling by bus, train, transit, taxi, car pooling, bicycling, tram, trolley, walking, skating or even the interesting inventions we see by people all the time. There are many different ways that you can avoid having to drive your own car. It isn't a hassle. It's also a stress reliever, and helps you not get worried about how your going to avoid that five o'clock rush hour traffic jam that you have to sit and yell at people in. Not only does it probably save you money not having to buy gas every couple of days, it also helps you and the enviroment. Breathing cleaner air helps you to live longer than breathing air that has all that smog, and nastiness in the air. Your city is only a step in a new direction, and it's only a matter of how you want to do it. There's optoins, like you hear in the insruance commercials, that you can take and be just fine. There's a lot of advantages to the limiting of car uses, and the carfree days. It's just on you whether or not you want to take that route, make a change in your daily habit, and find that simple way to limit your car usage.",0
"""CarFree Cities"" gave the reader a broad perspective on the advantages of limiting car usage. The world would become a more ecofriendly and overall good place if we were to make this change happen all over the world. The passages give great reasoning to why this change should happen.

Limiting our usage on cars would help the environment completely. The amount of pollution would have a massive decrease. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced partial driving ban to clear the air."" This statement comes from the passage, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" and gives an example on how having driving restrictions would make the world more healthy for the economy. Using other ways for transportation could help prevent the enormous amount of pollutants in the air, like bicycles or car pooling. ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" This example shows ways we can have transportation instead everyone individually using cars and causing more pollution.

Instead of driving, riding a bike or walking to the places you need to go could be a huge stress reliever. People need to go outside and get fresh air, this can happen if we decrease the use of our cars or vehicles. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This statement was said in the passage, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" and gives a perfect example on how using different types of transportation can relieve one's stress and lower the pollution on the world and the economy.

When no longer using so many cars, and vehicles the traffic would decrease majorly. Not as many people would be driving if carpooling or using other ways of transportation like bikes. This will also make the number of wrecks or accidents go down since not as many people would be in the situation for this to happen. Having less accidents would also save lots of lives, so many people die or get severly injured from car accidents and this can be a way to keep so many deaths or injuries from happening.

The idea of having a carfree environment is a great plan for the future and would be a positive change for the world and the environment we live in.",0
"We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College is corrupt compared to popular vote. They're more cons than pros about the Electoral College. A lot of people agree that we should change our voting to popular vote. Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important.

The Electoral College System is wrong. In source two, Bradford Plumer said that ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said ""they can be anyone not holding public office"" and ""electors could always defy the will of the people"". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors"". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate.

The Electoral College system is said to be unfair to voters in source two. The Electoral College system has a ""winnertakeall"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winnertakeall"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". I agree with plumer, the electoral College needs to go.

Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros. In source three Posner give you the ""five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". Posner said the first reason was ""certainty of outcome"". The second reason is ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"". the third and fourth reason is ""swing states"" and ""big states"". the fifth reason is the Electoral College system can ""avoid runoff elections"". These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness?

We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a ""winnertakeall"" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"".",0
"Cars are a very, very common mode of transportation used all over the world. People depend on cars to get them from place to place every single day. While driving cars seem to be the quickest and easiest form of transportation, there are negative sides to it. These negative effects can be harmful to the environment and humans if we aren't careful. Therefore, citizens should take a step forwards limiting their car usage. The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle.

When cars are used, they can pollute the air with harmful chemicals and toxins. Air pollution is a serious issue that is occurring around the globe. This is important because cars are polluting the air we need in order to survive. Some cities around the world have gotten so polluted that they had to restrict people from using cars over a period of time to try and cleanse the air. If you drove during the ban, then you would receive a fine. Paris and bogota are two cities that participated in the ban. After the pollution cleared up some, the ban was lifted in both cities. Therefore, reducing the air pollution is a major advantage to not using your car as much.

Over time, cars can use up a lot of resources. Cars run on gasoline, which is a fossil fuel. There is only so much of it and once it's gone, it's gone. Our fossil fuels are being used up quick, so it's time to start saving them. You can save resources by driving around less. Instead of driving yourself, you could either walk, ride a bicycle, skate, ride a bus, or carpool with some friends. These are all ways you could help save the planet's resources.

Lastly, limiting how much you drive your car can be beneficial because it is a healthier lifestyle for you. You could get more excerise and help the environment at the same time. One community in Germany, named Vauban, gave up their cars completely. They are in a movement called ""smart planning."" This community gets around by walking or riding bicycles. Their lifestyle includes having stores and markets a walk away so they have easier access to them. Having a healthier lifestyle is an advantage because it's important to take care of yourself.

The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle. Driving less reduces smog because it helps clean the air from toxins. It also helps save the limited amount of fossil fuels that we have. Not to mention, driving your car less will give you a chance to live a healthier lifestyle because you will get much more excercise. Overall, driving less is beneficial to both humans and the environment. Therefore, join the movement and limit your car usage.",0
"When people ask for advice they automatically just trust the opinion of others but also ask many others for their opinions and here is why...

People will trust an indavujal but not trust their opinion, Because the little part of you disagrees and that is natural you are two totally different people. You will go to others to weigh out their opinion and see which one is better you could get two opinions one person is foolish lets say you just asked them first. The other person is wise will you follow the first opinion or go seek out another. Which will be a wise opinion from a wise person or a opinion from a foolish person. However everyone wants a wise persons advice but what if that foolish person. Has a wiser moment in that opinion than the wise one, you will never know when one is truly wise unless. You take the time to see for yourself The foolish one may be the wiser one does not matter their intelligence the only thing that. Really matters is their opinion and the reason behind it so seek out both opinions and truly see which opinion fits the description of what your looking for in an answer. For example, if you only take one opinion than you wont have anything weigh out in the end. You dont only have to seek out only two you can do as many as you like just write them own and see which was is the best way to go.",0
"Do you believe in aliens? If so, what is your evidence? In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", conspiracy theorists believe in 1976 the Viking snapped a photo of an alien face on Mars. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor re-took the photo of the Face with sharper cameras. The Face on Mars is a natural landform that appeared as an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Cydonia, or Red Planet, revealed unusal shawdows which made the Face look like an Egyptian Pharaoah. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. After released on the JPL web site, the photo revealed a natural landform. Later in 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took another trip to Cydonia on a cloudless summer day. They snapped an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum pixel use. The picture later revealed a Martian equivalent of a butte.

After all of the photos being investigated, the photos revealed a landform shaped like a Face. NASA proved to conspriacy theorists that they were not hiding anything about the Face on Mars. The MOC team also proved that the photos did not show any evidence of an alien face on Mars. Finally, the MGS, NASA, and the MOC teams all revealed the photos to the public on the JPL web site for the public to view and leave there opinion on the Face on Mars.",0
"Do you seek multiple opinions for advice or anything in general, because I do. Asking three or more people for their opinions on something will be a more accurate and better way to make a choice or get advice, than asking one individual for her or his opinion. When your in a situation that requires you to make a difficult choice, than seeking multiple opinions will give you a better chance at making the right decision. Your answer wont necessarily be wrong if you ask one person, but it'll more likely be wrong than correct. I think seeking multiple opinions is a great way to decide on something your not sure about, because it gives you a better chance at making the right choice, more choices to choose from, and your gonna be more confident about your answer.

Asking multiple people for their opinions will give you a higher chance at making the right decision. Having a better chance at making the right choice is something everyone wants. A higher chance at making the right choice will make you feel great. Your choice will almost definitely be correct if your parents agree with you. At the end when you make the right decision you will be happy and satisfied with your self for asking multiple people for their opinions.

Having more choices to choose from is great. If your not sure about any of the choices that you came up with, than you can ask for other peoples opinions which will give you more decisions you can make. You can ask your friends or family to help you make a decision if your not sure. You also have your teachers that can help you out, and give you more helpful tactics. If you have a lot of choices than you will at least feel good about one or two of them. thats why I think having more choices to choose from is great.

Feeling confident about your decision is important. If your not confident about your decision, than ask the people around you for their opinions. They might agree with you and support your answer. If they agree with you than you should be confident about your answer. You shouldn't loose your confidence only if a few people disagree with you, because there will always be people who agree. Confidence is the key to everything.

I think seeking multiple opinions is great because you will have a higher chance of your decision being correct, more people will agree with your choice, and you will feel confident at the end. I like asking multiple people for their opinions on something, because sometimes they have ideas that I feel more confident about than mine. My sisters always help me out when I ask for their thoughts about something. Making choices can be difficult if you dont ask multiple people for their opinions on it. Thats why I love asking multiple people for their thoughts on something I am having trouble making a choice on.",0
"In the article called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about making humans express emotions by using a computer. Many scientists are finding out why it is possible to show emotions by using technology. First of all, Leonardo da Vinci created Mona Lisa during the Renissance. What something people don't know is the painting of the woman actually shows different emotions by moving parts of her face. For many decades, people from all over the world are attracted and have experienced the same thing. Years later, a group of scientists named Dr. Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe started to calculate human facial movements by computer. They wanted to show how people feel back in the past decades. In addition, what people call the artwork Mona Lisa ""the only moving picture ever existed."" No matter where you are, no matter where you stand, Mona Lisa can still stare at you. No one knows what make the human parts move. In conclusion, I think that the movement of human parts on Mona Lisa is the greatest achievement to have for Leonardo da Vinci because it would be remembered by millions of people around the world.",0
"NASA thinks that it was made by the planet being made because aliens do not exist. You can not just guess at how it was made. This is why NASA thinks you are wrong. Aliens could not have made this because they do not exist, it would take a long time to make anything that scale, and it would take them years to make.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue they do not exist. This is why NASA thinks this. Aliens would have to have good construction and excavtion equipment. As you would say, they don't need that stuff they just built it. However, there is no physicaly possible way that they could have made it without the equipment. In order to build they would need this equipment. All together aliens could not have made this because they are not capable and do not exist.

Aliens could not have made the face because it would take a long time to make anything that scale. Here is why they could not have done it. They don't have the capablities to make anything like the face on Mars. The people that think otherwise would say that it isn't a natural land form. However, NASA scientist where comparing it to other natural landforms. That is why NASA thinks that it is impossible for the aliens to make anything to that scale.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue it would take to long. Here is why NASA is proving facts. This is not possible in any shape, way, or form because it would take over 300 years to do so. You would say that the aliens just bulit it as we bulid buliding today. But, they would have to have constrcution workers working every single day for this to happen and that is why NASA says it is impossible. Together that is why I do not think is is possible.

In conclusion, aliens do not exist, do not have cababilatlies to make anything to that scale, and it would take to long that is why aliens could not have made this face. People get their hopes up about things to easily that is why NASA does not think any of this is even near possible. It would be better if NASA told evryone the full truth.",0
"I disagree,and here on my reasons. If you just believe on your imagination then knowledge it wouldnt end up go for you. 1,people would think your crazy. 2,people would not even believe it would even work or would ever come true. Lastly,people would just think its plain old dumb if you believe in that.

I think people would think your crazy because if you keep living on your imagination then you'll get to stcuk in your own little games your in,and you'll sometimes forget what the real world thinks of you. The worst to come is that you'll get to scared to come to even go out into the real world. Knowledge is a powerful thing that everyone has,and its more powerful than your own imagination. If yo keeping thinking about your own little world your own little world you live in,then you would just forget on how the real world is a scary place.

Second of all,If you have a big imagination,people would not even believe that it would ever come true. Reson number 1,people would just believe in whatever you do. Think about it,their are so many ideas that just shut down,like how bills get made but they dont even get to the second step of becoming a law. Reason number 2,Everyone judges on what you think and what you believe. Some might agree,but most of all they just think your werid or crazy. So yes, it's scary to think on what people believe in what you imagine.

Finally,People would just think your plain on dumb. If your imagination gets to out od hand,people would just think your dumb or disagree with you. Yes,it's werid or even sad to have people judge or think your done with your own fantasy. People won't take you seriosly. And if they don't take you like you mean business,then they just won't talk to you at all. And your left with nothing but your own ideas. So,its risky to have a really big imagination because people would just think your plain on dumb or they might take your ideas and leave you with nothing.

In conculsion,I don't think it would be a great idea to have a big imagination. Knowledge is best because people won't judge you,they wont think your crazy,and they would believe you a 100%. I think its great having a big imagination,but dont get to attach to your imagination.",0
"In my opinion i think that we shouldn't continue with elector college. I think we should change it to election by popular vote for president of the united state, it seems like it would be an easier process. The elector college is very very unfair, its a disaster, so it should be removed.

If we were to make it to were whoever became president was the one that had the most vote people would proabky be so much happier. More poeple would proably have the president of there choice if it worked that way. To make people happy give them what they want right? Well let us pick.

Elector college is a very unfair process! With the winner-take-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. So they focus on the staes they know they can win, they don't challenge themselfs. The easy way is always the right way!

The Elector college caused a very bad thing in 2000 the biggest electon crisis in the century happened. So clearly the Elector college can cause some very big problems to occur. I feel that voting this way is a very stupid thing to do and that vote by popularity should be the way that we vote for our president.

Its less complicated this way.",0

I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasn't like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, I'm not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it""

I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school.

Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. But that was not enough for me, I wanted to learn more, so I stared to used professional cameras and make homemade videos to practice a little big more; that same year my family decided to move to the United States. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didn't know If coming to America would change my dream,

everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I don't have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career.

These are just some of the reasons why you should select me to visit and learn more about your company, I know you may have more applications of students with better grades and experience than me, but no all of them have the passion and enthusiast that I have, because this wouldn't be just a job, I would be a the biggest accomplishment for me.",0
"Rough Draft

""Hey there,"" Someone yelled then you relize thats the call of friend that is about to ask for some advice. Many people take advice from others to help with problems they think they can't do by them self. Which leads to the question why take advice from others? They take advice because they don't neccarly need help, but want help to take the easy way out of things. By doing this they second guss them selfs and go and ask more people for more advise to see if the other person advice was wrong, or they have no idea what to do. If that's the case then they take the advice of others to help them with his/her problem by taking the best advice possible, asking how to do what you don't, and knowledge.

Firstly, by taking the best possible advice you would want to go to multiple people for there advice, experince, and help. By going to someone who has already given advice to others they will probably have a lot of imformation for you to have about your issue. If you go to someone with a ton of experince there advice would probaly be the best. Lastly if you go to someone with the experince you have you could give advice to each other, making it good for both of you.

Next, you could ask for tips or pointers on how to give advice to others, learning, and on how to take action. Asking for advice to give other people advice is a great idea if you want to help others out and yourself. By learning you could gain experince like Mrs. Generic_Name to advice to others. Lastly by taking action you take the advice you gain and give it to others.

Finaly, by going to multiple people you gain more knowledge including their perspectives, there reasons on what they would do, and how they would resolve the matter. First by knowing someones perspective you will know on how they would do stuff their own way. Second the reasons on why they would do what they are going to do will help with your actions by putting other reasons together. Lastly by knowing how they would solve the issue it would help to take others solutions all in all.

In conclusion, people who ask others for help are wanting the best advice possible, asking for tips they don't know how to do themselfs, and knowledge. Those who take advice will likely feel better when they actually use the advice to solve there problem and will enjoy it. So don't be afraid to ask for advice from others it will benifit you in the long run.",0
"For many years countries like the United States, France, and Germany idolized the cars that they managed to manufacture. This so-called ""love affair"" between people and their cars, though, has started to diminish, and it may be for the better. In the past, the people who owned the prettiest, loudest, and coolest cars considered themselves to be at the top of an automobile social structure, but now, new generations are starting to move away from buying cars. They've resorting to walking, bicycling, or taking a form of public transport. Sure, owning cars may make you ""better"" than everyone else, but at what cost?

Carbon dioxide emissions are at an all-time high, meaning that cars are harming the world more than helping it.

Yes, cars will be continue to be seen as cool, and owning cars will continue to be seen as cool, but nevertheless, with green house gases emitted from the tailpipes of cars ripping holes in the Earth's atmosphere, cars seem to be more of an impediment to the cause than an improvement.

Countries in Western Europe such as Paris and Germany have recognized that the exponential amounts of smog produced by cars are becoming dangerous. Legislators everywhere are taking cautious steps towards eliminating the gases that have a choke hold their cities. An official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg says ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" (Par. 7, Rosenthal). Cities in Paris and Germany are adopting a similar idea- developing cities than have a ban cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of these cities, dicouraging their 5,500 residents to give up their cars, charging them $40,000 to be able to park in one of the two garages in the city. As a result of these rules, 70% of the families that live in Vauban don't own a car, and 57% sold a car in order to live there (Par. 3, Rosenthal). The citizens are reported to be happier and less tense without a car, claiming that cars were the cause of their stress.

Communites like Vauban are set up in a way that makes life easy for the car-less citizens. In this approach, stores and offices are placed within walking distance from the houses, rather than in malls along some distant highway (Par. 6, Rosenthal). This has effectively reduced the amount of emissions of green-house gases drastically in Germany, and other countries around the world are starting to adopt Vauban's basic precepts in an attempt to make cities more compact (Par. 6, Rosenthal).

Paris, France is one of these cities that is revolutionizing its transportation. Paris has more smog than any other European counry, with 147 micrograms of particulate matter in the air, compared to 79.7 micrograms in London (Par. 17, Duffer). The smog rivaling that of Beijing, China, attempts were made by the government to reduce this smog, fining motorists for two days if they were found using their cars. France, having tax policies that favored the use of diesel over regular gas, blamed diesel fuel for it's record pollution levels.

Bogota, Colombia ran into a similar problem with it's high numbers of carbon dioxide emissions. The country has developed an atmosphere improvement campaign in the 1990's, constructing hiking and bicycle paths to encourage people to go ""car-free"". For the Day Without Cars, alternative transportation like taxis, buses, and bicycles are promoted, and violators that use their cars on this day are fined $25. Despite the constant rain, participants still turned out, claiming that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution,"" (Par. 24, Selsky).

Other cities in Colombia have joined the event such as Cali and Valledupar. The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, hearing about the revolutionary event says ""These people are genertaing a revolutionary change, anf this is crossing borders,"" (Par 26, Selsky). Since the Day Without Cars' institution, parks and sports centers have prospered, sidewalks and roads have been repaved, and traffic congestion has been dramatically reduced (Par. 28, Selsky). The appeal of car culture is decreasing, and it has effected countries all over the world.

An ""incipient shift"" in American's behavior over the last few years sugests that the American people are driving less, buying fewer cars, and getting fewer licenses every year (Par. 29, Rosenthal). The number of miles driven by Americans peaked in 2005, and has been diminishing steadily after that. Due to the recession, the majority of Americans couldn't afford to buy new cars, meaning that less people were driving.

Mimi Sheller, a sociology professer states that, ""Different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" (Par. 35, Rosenthal). What she says is true; carpooling, van and public transportation services, and bike-sharing programs are the most populat they've ever been. Shifts in the population of drivers may accelerate the current trend, and the ""cash-strapped"" Americans that can't afford a car may never actually have to buy one.

The teenage and young adult population has been affected by this cultural shift aswell, with many teenagers not bothering to get a liscence. They figure out other ways to get around, and revolve their schedules arounf where they can walk or which friend they can ride with. Driving by young people is at an all-time low, dropping by 23% between 2001 and 2009 (Par. 41, Rosenthal). Many young people are adopting the ideas that owning, or even driving vehicles is impractical, or even undesirable. This mind-set, in turn, is reducing green house gas emissions unintentionally.

Over the years car and culture trends have changed multiple times, and this trend occurring now is probably the best one yet. Reducing carbon dioxide and green house gas emissions is very important, and this current philosophy and outlook on cars is aiding the elimination of those harmful gases. ""Pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commecial and public traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" (Par. 43, Rosenthal). Overall, this idea is helping the Eath, unlike the many ideas before it. Limiting car use has had a positive effect on the world, and has been advantageous in many countries  in helping them revitialize their cities.",0
"Success is said to be hard with a negative attitude, but why should attitude define the destiny of a person? Life is full of surprises but with a good attitude you can overcome just about anything. A great attitude isn't obtained by many but it certainly isn't hard to get. All success in life leads back great attitude and awesome mentality. The Key to success is to have a positive attitude and mind set because the person with a positive attitude will gain a healthier life style, a better career, and money.

Positive attitude comes from a good mentality and when people have that they see life differently. People who have this characteristic usually don't stress as much because they change the negative to positive. They have patience and don't get irritated so easily or in other words they are unbothered by others. Giving up is never an option especially if it deals with something they love or a dream they have. Since they do not stress as much, don't let others get under their skin, and rarely give up they live healthier and happier.

Careers are a perfect example of the power of good attitude; If a doctor goes into work saying ""I'm not smart enough for this job."" Is it possible that his way of thinking limits the way he works? it may, because he will go on with his day giving 50 percent when he needs to give 100 percent. If he would've change the way he thought maybe to ""if i wasn't smart enough for this job i wouldn't have gone this far."" Now he would be giving 100 percent instead of 50 percent. Since he is giving 100 percent all the time it will make him stand out since he is not just another employee. Employers might just move him up to something more important or give him a raise.

Money is something worked and sweated for, and for those who have to work ten times harder than others generally fix their mentality and attitude. If achieving a goal in life is so hard, then why did most High school drop outs become something great? Not all but the ones who did succeed in life they were determined and had a positive attitude about struggles they encountered. Money is all over the place it just takes the right mind set and attitude to get it. Although money doesn't give you eternal happiness a good attitude will.

Attitude may not fix all of your problems but it sure does give your life a different route. Great minds all have something in common their mind set and attitude. Great attitude takes in life and makes them better. There are many keys in life there is one made for success and that's attitude. Three things that are there once you open the door is a better life style, better opportunities, and more money.  ",0
"In my opinion I

think is better to work in group because has a lot of benefits. One of the example is the group help to think better,

each other and fast. second the workes is help to earn more money for the company and for the workes.

The first reason the workes is help to find information and internet or and books when some one had a problem like some one in the group is sick the other ones substitute in a job, sometimes in a group has a lot inconvenient like someone disagreement but then can fix an any problem to solve because they are professional.

The second reason is to earn money and hours,

when the workes work great an a job the company is pay more better , in a group is more beneficial for the company and for workers an extra hours,

because they do more efficient job, and also workes can help to earn more business with other companies and other countries more practical to work in a group they can help each other.

In conclusion I think is more beneficial to work in a group for several reason one of then is more easy to think in group help each other when the work is difficulty. Other reason is more practical to work and earn money for company and for workers and its beneficial to work with other companies.                                                ",0
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

Striving to meet the challanges of Venus has valve , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimadating endeavours. Venus is a good place for exploration because, it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth and, it allows Scientists to float above the fray and also NASA is looking back at an old technology called Mechanical Computers .

Venus is a good place for exploration because it has some features that are analogous to those earth. In the article, it states ,""Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported various forms of life , just like Earth .Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"" . Also, the article states, "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar featires such as Valley ,Mountains and Craters . Venus has features of the Earth surface such as oceans and valleys , it is an interesting place where peolpe would like to go and have fun .

Venus has become an exicting place for people toexplore because National astronautics And Space has made it easy for Scientists to float above the fray . In the article, it states ,"" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particular compelling idea for sending human to study venus . Also , the article states, ""NASA's posssible solution........Venus would allow Scientists to float above the fray"".

NASA is sending Scientists to make it easy for vehicles over Venus to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions .They want Temperature to be toasty , air pressure should be close to the sea level on Earth and radiation would not exceed Earh levels but make it survivable for Humans.

NASA has found another old technology called Mechanical Computers instead of using mobile phones that can cause explosion . This has made it easier for the exploration of Venus . In the article ,it states, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called Mechanical Computers"".

Also , the article states , Modern computers are enorously poewerful , flexible, and quick"" .

In conclusion ,Venus should be an exciting place to study because it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth ,allows Scientists to float above the fray and NASA is looking back at an old tecnology called Mechanical Computer .",0
"The author suggested studying Venus is worthy pursuit depite the danger it presents by pointing out the characterstics of the planet. One of the things he mentioned was that it is simple to see from distance of the earth. Venus is also known as Earth's ""twin"", which shows that it is not a dangerous place for people to live in. During the roatation of the planet we are are closer to Mars and sometimes we are closer to Venus. The author used his knowledge to evaluate how good Venus is based on it's characterstics.

One of the things he mentioned was that, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system. even though Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus is the hottest plantet. This hot temerature lead to having volcanoes, earthquakes and many other things related to the hot weather.

The second thing that he talked about was that, scientists proved that Venus and Earth used have a lot in common. one of the things was that, Venus was covered by oceans like Earth and had a chance of having living things. ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary."" This qoute supports the idea how Earth and Venus have a lot in common and alike. Which means that Venus is not a dangerous place for human to live in.

""NASA

has one particularly compelling idea of sending humans to study Venus."" scientists think that Venus would be a good place to float around and to visit, which means that Venus is not a dangerous place for human beings except some weather problems. Another thing they mentioned was that solar power might be plentiful and the planet is survivable for human beings.

Overall the author used informations from scientists and from the NASA to support his claim. He discussed about the weather of the planet and other characterstics. He also included how Venus and Earth are simillar and what things they have in common. One thing he mentioned was that Venus was covered with oceans just like Earth and it is rocky and has mountain and valleys. All those common characters shows that human beings are able to live in this planet.",0
"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states very clearly how beneficial studying Venus would be, despite all the dangers. Even after learning how harsh the conditions are on ground level, for some reason, the author still believes the danger would be worth it. Though my own opinion may vary from the author's, they still give very convincing reasons for their point of view. According to the article, the main two reasons Venus would be beneficial for humans to study would be the amount of information that could be learned about the landscape of Venus millions of years ago, and to satisfy human curiosity while having the satisfaction completing a challenge we have been faced with for centuries.

Though the author gives several convinving reasons for studying Venus, perhaps the most influential would be the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus. In paragraph four, the author discusses that Venus displays several features similar to Earth, meaning it is possible Venus used be a whole lot like Earth. As stated directly in paragraph four, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" Solely based off the information provided in this quote, the author has already begun to convince me learning more about Venus might actually lead to some pretty extraordinary discoveries. What this quote is saying is millions of years ago Venus may have been the planet with the most liveable conditions...instead of Earth. If scientists were able to discover this much, just imagine all the other life forms and food webs that could be uncovered. To reinforce their opinion on Venus potentislly being liveable in the past, the author states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can cometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" at the end of paragraph four. What the author is saying in this quote is at this point, all we have to do is find out how to brave the conditions of Venus. As for travel time, Venus is practically our neighbor, so no worries there.

A secondary reason the author provides as to why humans should study Venus is to satisfy human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task that has troubled humans for centuries. The author states this idea in paragraph eight when saying, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" In this quote, the author is saying due to the fact that humans are extremely curious, we will likely find ourselves in a predicament with similar tough challenges in the future, so we may as well begin working through some of them now. When one sets out to complete a task, they should not stop halfway, but follow through until the problem is solved. They also should not quit because they believe the challenge is too hard. If one is able to stick with their guts and do what needs to be done, they will reap the benefits. Whether those benefits be winning a tough volleyball match or finally sending a human to Venus, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that we do not stop believing in ourselves and our ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible.

In conclusion, the author has given many, specifically two, very convincing reasons as to why we should continue to study Venus. The main two reasons are the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus, and satisfying human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task which has troubled humans for centuries. Based on the authors suggestions on why humans should continue to study Venus, I have considered changing my mind and agreeing that the dangers would be worth it. It is important to have knowledge about the past of our solar system, and it would be very interesting to know if Venus was once able to support various forms of life. I also feel that the author made a good point in stating that we are already this far into studies, so we should not give up now. Humans are always going to be insatiably curious, so by not finding a solution to this problem now, we are just placing this challege upon the generation following us. After all, curiosity technically never killed the cat.",0
"The number of positive connotations that limiting car usage around the world would have on society is infinite. It would lower congestion, promote more healthy and efficient means of travel, and it would reduce emissions by a very large factor. People around the world are turning towards methods of transportation that do not monopolize on the automobile. Maybe one day cars will be pass?

According to a study in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after prohibiting driving for a few days, and fining those who disregarded the experiment. Less congestion led to less road noise, which, in turn, made people ""happier."" It created a safer environment for children and parents alike. Having fewer cars on the road encouraged people to go outside whenever they could. Citizens of Vauban, a city in Germany, are taking this newfound peacefulness to an extreme. Driving is forbidden in their city and there are not any available parking spaces in the event that they still own a car! Vauban is an example of a city that was built based on ""smart planning."" More communities are adopting this ideal and try to have everything located within walking distance of a person's home. This encourages people to get to where they need to go without the use of an automobile. People nowadays also have the technology to communicate with others electronically, so that reduces the need for an automobile to get from point A to point B. Why waste the time and money on gas to communicate with someone when you could send them an email or text for a low cost in a matter of seconds?

This being said, limiting car usage promotes public transportation services. In Bogota, 118 miles worth of bicycle paths have been built in an effort to steer people away from automobiles. This encourages people to get from place to place via a healthy and fun means of transport. Undoubtedly, people are more likely to stay close to home without the accessibility of cars, so limiting the use of cars saves the time that would be spent on the roads.

Limiting car usage has major benefits when it comes to carbon emissions and environmental problems. President Obama has wanted to curb the United States' emissions and so far his goal is a success. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Smog has been severely reduced in countries around the globe since plans to limit car usage have gone into effect.

Limiting car usage might seem like something that ""would be good in theory,"" and it will definitely be a hard thing for today's generation to wrap their head around, but the positive impacts it would have on society are limitless. Congestion and emissions would be reduced, time spent commuting would be saved, and the world would be a much safer place to live in overall. Limiting car usage everywhere is definitely something to think about.",0
"Studying Venus is dangerous but there is good insight we can find in this.

First,In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""Earth's ""Twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Since it has a lot in common with Earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet. In the article it says that"" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys, moutains, and craters"" this shows how much Earth and venus have incommon. This also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to Venus in the future. Despite the dangers it could cause on someone.

Next, in the reading it says that Venus has"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxid blankets"" This is one example of how dangerous Venus is. In the article is says"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun"" This is another example of how dangers Venus is. However going to Venus is not a bad idea beacuse life form could have been there in the past. People believe life forms could have existed beacuse of the examples like caters, moutains, and valleys. Despite Venus being the hottest planet in our solar system.

Then, on that note Venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet's in the solar system. However studying Venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface. While we have been studying Venus all we have seen is a look from a ship orbiting above the planet, that gives us little intel on it surface. We get little intil from that beaucse "" most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"". However if scientists seeking to conduct Venus will have to get closer to the planet.

Lastly, in the reading it says"" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" but not all people know that Venus is not a star it is a planet. However to a amateur stargazer it may just look like another star. Venus is called Earths twin beaucse of how alike they are in distance. Some scientist think this is intersting and want to look into this planet despite the dangers of it. Some scientist have looked into Venus but only have sent unmanned trips. The reasoning is the ship would only last a new hours at the most on Venus.

In Conclusion,Venus is a every intersitng plaet to look into. Despite the dangers it can cause.",0
"I think studing venus is a good idea becuase there a proboly a lot of new thing to descover on venus. Venus is the cloest planet to earth in the terms of density and size. Even tho each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more then a few hours, and it will still be a good risk for a new life. Not a single spaceship has touchdown on venus in more then three decades. I think studying venus is a good idea because the spaceship that was up there never made it back and one day sombody will. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 precent carbon dioxide blankets venus. the clouds are even more challenging (of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere). Venus has the hottest surface temerature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venus is almost's earth twin but it is just hard to get there and take a long time. There are alot of things that people haven't found yet but are geting closer to finding, it's up to them to bring it back. they are still tring new ways to study venus. for example, (some simplified simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition). They are trying many different ways to study venus, they are looking back toan old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during the world war 2. I think that they should still study venus becaus it is a lot of thing that haven't found yet.",0
"Making decisions can be hard sometimes but it can become quite easier when you go to others for help. I've came up with a couple of reasons and examples to why it is better to ask more than one person for help when you con to a bump int he road.

Everyone has thought of different strategies to do an activity so why not go see things from others perspective. Here's an example of what this might look like. Lets say it almost 1 in the morning and your out with your friends and you were supposed to be home by 12am. You guys were just jamming to music while driving to go get some food. Your phone starts ringing and you realize that it was your mom. You panic so u just let it ring. She called a couple more times after so you turn to your friends and ask them what you should say. Everyone said to not worry about it and just relax besides one person. He told you that you need to answer here and at least tell her that you are safe and where your going. He has been in the same situation before and chose to do the the wrong choice and regretted it later when the cops were searching for him.

Asking more than 1 person can also give you more verities to chose from and give you thought that you never would have. Imagine that you are planning a surprise party for one of you family members that are moving from a different country. You don't know what they are interested in so you go to family members that have met them before and ask questions like, What's their favorite type of food? What activities do they think are fun? Etc. By the time the move you will have plenty of options for the food, party theme, games, and music!

At the end of the day, asking for help from multiple people isn't a problem because you never know what kind advice you might get in return. Just know that it all comes down to you to decide who you would rather listen to. And who can trust.",0

The workplace i choose was the Hospital because i see people doing surgery on people and i would love to do it so i can see there organs that i never seen before . I would like to vist it so i can se the baby's , mental people , elderly people ,and other people .I would like to take care of the baby's cause i like to take good care of them and i like to go see them each time and they also cry alot but it is really fun . When your parent is sick and you are a doctor you know what to do right away .Sometimes people are so close to get a heart attack but when you are there you save there life alot . I like to work at places were i can take to people and i like it to cause when you have other jobs and people barely talk to you it is boring and at hospital you can go to other people's room and can say how was your day and talk with them and tell them how do they feel. That's why i want to work at the hospital to have fun with them take good care of them they would like me alot cause i used to be a person that tooked care of old people and i used to play with alot and made them to color with me . They also liked to play with me tag but i always ' said yes and they would be so happy and we only played for a little bit because they would get tired. I would like to write this to the manager/employee because i would like to be making everyone feel good and not sick anymore. I would like to be in the news saying that i saved lots of people's live and that i was making them have much more life and i would like to be a doctor that people would like to go to and i would want everyone to come to me or make a appointment if they are sick and i can cure it any day i want just with a hint of a tool that can help me .I would like to see the organs because lets say you havent seen a organ but you want to see it so bad. I that's why you should always choose to do surgery but sometimes' people faint cause they see the blood alot. some people would like to see other people's organs .thats' why i would like to become a doctor but sometimes some people don't want you to touch them cause sometimes they say you dont wash your hand . I would wash my hand's all the time and make them smell my hands so they can know that i washed them.

thats why always wash your hands.

That's a good choice cause you want to be healthy and always run never stop doing laps outside cause you would not be healthy just by staying inside eating all day . I would like to take good care of the people that are super sick cause it is nice to be a doctor you walk all around and see lots of people.",0
"A world without cars is kind of hard to imagine right? Well not for most countreis anymore. Cars are becoming less and less desirable as the years go on. The peak was in 2005 and then has been slowly decreasing. Younger people like the ideas of cars but don't really need one. New York has subways, taxi's, and others are carpooling to  destinations. France has alreayd issued a ban on cars and has even had certain cars banned on certain days. For instance, even number car plates could not be used for driving on Monday's, odd number plates were banned for Tuesday's. This was to help reduce the amount of smog in the French air as they rely mostly on diesel rather than gas. In Vauban, Germany street parking, driveways and home garages have been banned from neighborhoods. You could now only buy a house with a garage for $40,000. This cause more people to stop using cars, and others to sell them to live in the upscale neighborhoods. Many of the Ford and Mercedes car dealerships are considering changing their train of car producing to the newer ideal of intertiwning public transportation with the up and coming ideas of bikers on the rodes, and people using buses and subways instead of their own cars.

In Paris the smog in the air was soon thicker than it was in Beijing, China the citied known for its polluted air. Soon Parisian officials enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the smog. Monday's, motorists with even-numbered plates had been ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, which is also $31. The same requirements were set in place for odd-numbered plates the following day. The first time this new ban was enforced nearly 4,000 dirvers were fined. Some even had their cars impounded for thier reaction to the new fine. The amount of traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after the five days of an intensifying smog. The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days that caused the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions. Diesel fuel was, of course, blammed as France has a tax policy for diesel fuel over gassoline. 67 percent of vehicles in Frane, compared to the 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris would typically have more smog than the other European countries with the percentage of diesel fule they use daily. Paris had 147 micrograms of diesel per cubic meter last week compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Delivery companies lost revenue, but this starte an exception for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Soon the smog had cleared anouth on Monday for the ruling French party to take away the ban for odd-numbers plates on Tuesday.

The United States has long since been one of the world's prime car cultures. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse has emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitious assist from a incipient shift in American behavior.",0
"Some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing something because if they are then they might not have time to do the other work they are given or they might be busy with the hard work first then maybe finish the work. But inactivity also serve as a purpose because some people aren't doing anything so they have time to finish and accomplish something because they are not doing anything

The first reason that inactivity should serve as a purpose is because people that aren't doing anything should be able to accomplish their work and other work so that they did not finish and they dont have an excuse to not do work. On the other hand people doing work have an excuse because if they are given a lot for work they might not have time to finish the other work but the people that finish working and have some time left should be given more work in till they done have anymore time at school or at work.

The first reason why people accomplish something when they are doing something is because they work and don't waste time at school or work but sometime. The second reason is that they don't accomplish work when they are doing something because they won't have time to finish the other work or they rush ans make a lot of mistake on their work and will get a bad report are grade on it so thats why some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing other things.

So inclusion some people accomplish their work and some don't also inactivity serve as a purpose for people that are done with their work but class or they are still work should not just sit there and do nothing they should get more work in till they leave the class or their jobs.",0
"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth and is also reffered to as our sister planet. We have sent many probes to Venus, yet many have not survived more than a few hours. Venus may be very close to us compared to other planets in our solar syestem, but it is far different in its characteristics. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author shows how Venus is dangerous but still worthy of studying by giving us evidence and examples about Venus and its features.

The author gives us statistical evidence on how our planet is different from Venus. He explains that its temperature, atmosphere, and its acidic clouds are making the planet uninheritable for humans. The author writes, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (3) The other spits out many facts that support his claim that exploring Venus is a very dangerous job. 800 degrees Farenheit is very hot and would not eb suitable by a human. In fact, all of these feaures would make it hard for a human to live on Venus. All these points can help prove that Venus is still worthy of studying even though there are many dangers because it should interests scientists and others to find out how these conditions came to be, what could survive in these harmful conditions, and even possibly how to make it possible for humans to live there.

The author also uses examples to support his claim that Venus is inhospitable for humans. Humans have many needs in order to survive on a planet and Venus does not qualify for many. The author writes ""such an environment woud crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to teh deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" (3) In this quote the athor is referring to the pressure of the planet inside the atmosphere. If a submarine could not survive the pressure, I doubt a human could either. The author also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system"" and it has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This is impreessive beause even probes that are specifically made for going to Venus, cant even survive on Venus. This proves that Venus is very dangerous but still worthy of studying because it challenges scientists to find new ways of making stronger probes and new ways to study this planet that prove effective.

The author uses many peices of statictcal evidence and examples to prove his point that Venus is worthy of studying even considering the dangerous conditions. It is worthy because it has insanely harsh temperature, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and other harmful characteristics. Would you want to study Venus considering its deadly differences?",0
"We don't need them if we all work together Car pool denser cities alts will be available public transit Sidewalks roads Convenients1l6 Better for uscan still interact without overdrivinginteractive bikingwalking online interaction Giving our cars up in this day and age seems impossible but if everyone can work together, new opportunities will arise that'll outweigh the convenience of having a personal vehicle. We won't need cars if we all work and cooperate with one another. Not only that but it'll become more cost effective and convenient as a whole in the long run. Once all is said and done, limiting car usage can only be positive.

Many questions would arise if this idea was approached, wouldn't we take longer to get places? Isn't it inconvenient and a stepback from personal commuting? The answer would be yes, but for the most part it's the point. Sure you make take longer to get places by car pooling or taking public transit, but if anyone is doing it there'll be no comparison of time with personal commuting, personal commuting will be gone. If no cars were available cities would compensate with free bikes when commuting or public transit. The nocar weekend in Paris allowed free public transit, so in the longterm it'd also be free Source 2. City planning would be modified to compensate for the increased commuting time making the long commutes a little easier. If we all work together we won't need cars, and in the end it'd be positive overall.

In a world of reduced personal commuting, the cost of living would improve as well. Money spent on gas or car maintenance would be nonexistent. Instead of using taxes on expensive roads, they'll be used on inexpensive sidewalks, just like in Bogota Source 3. With the extra cash from no car expenses it'll be easier to purchase luxury items you may want. Cities will be made with convenience in mind, placing key stores in easily accessible areas, similarly to vaughn's store placement Source 1. This would answer the question of inconvenience, A ten minute drive can become a ten minute bike or walk with strategic placement. In the end, a reduced car usage society would be more cost effective and convenient, a definite positive compared to an automobile society.

Cars are definitely important to many people, but only because the majority have cars. Take everyone's cars away and they wouldn't have a reason to need one. If we all work together we won't need cars, people will help one another and cities would be planned better. In this society you'd have more money to use as you please, instead of using it to survive. Most important of all, the time to take a car someplace rather than any other alternative would be the same important locations can always relocate for everyone's convenience. A world without cars can only be positive.",0
"I think Venus not is a worthy pursuit because of the dangers. Venus is too hot for human to live on it's too close to the sun. The atmosphere of Venus it too thin it lets too much heat into the planet. We wont be able to survive. How do you now we will have enogh oxygen on venus to live.

First, the planet Venus it toohot for human life to survive. Venus is the second plantes from the sun it's too close to the sun for us to even try to make it there. Also no one knows how long it will take us to get to Venus wonder if the spacecraft run's out of oxygen. If it run's out of oxygen everyone will die before theyy make it to Venus, but wonder if they do make it to Venus it might not be a lot of oxygen to breathe in because the planet is so hot. Then wonder if there no water you need water to survive ecause Earth is a liquid based planet,but Venus is not.

Secondly, how do we no if the spacecraft will be able to take that type of heat. The palnet surface temperatures on Venus average over 800 degrees fahrenheit I know that's way too hot. That type of temperature is beyond of what I can imagine I know Earth's surface is hot, but not that hot. Venus atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide I think it's like that, because it's so close the sun. The closer you get to the sun the more radiant energy it gives off and too much radiant energy can be bad. Like how do we know that the spacecraft will still be getting singnal from Earth, because wonder if the eletronic gadgets over heat and just give out because the planet is so hot.

Lastly, they say that venus is our twin planet. I don't see how it can be our twin planet because it so hot and it's very radiant. The planet Venus has a rocky sediment and icludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Earth and Venus can be twins because Earth is not rocky it's a liquid based planet. Venus has a thin atmosphere because the heat keeps it's so hot and thin it can't get a break to even expand. But Earthis not as close, so Earth's atmosphere is a little bit thicker the Venus's atmosphere. Venus might also have some harmful chemicals. I say this because how do we know what's on the planet its could be all types of harmful gases from the sun. We never know what's there on Venus or what could happen if we go.

In conclusion,

I think Venus not is a worthy pursuit because of the dangers. Venus is too hot for human to live on it's too close to the sun. The atmosphere of Venus it too thin it lets too much heat into the planet. We wont be able to survive. How do you now we will have enogh oxygen on venus to live. We don't know how long it will take to get there and how much supplies we will need to take and what supplies to even take. It's al ot to think about before we could eventhink about living on Venus. We would need to figure a lot of things off first before we go.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is better for the environment, it is safer, and it cost people less in the stuggling economy.

To begin, limiting the usage of cars is a advantage because it is better for the environment. For example, ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer. It is sad that there is so much pollution in the air that car usage has to be stopped in order for the smog in the air to decrease. After five days of smog, congestion was down by sixty percent in the capital of France. Obviously, limiting car usage is extremely better for the environment.

In addition, the less you use cars, the safer your community is. For example, Heidrun Walter ""...walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chattering of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" Rosenthal. Children coul not be wandering aroundif there were cars on the road. There are accidents all the time where children and adults get struck by cars even when they are trying to be safe. Obviously, if cars are not on the road, it will be safer for everyone.

Finally, limiting car usage saves people money. Actually, ""...Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" Rosenthal. The less that cars are used, the less gas people have to pay for and so they will save their hard earned money. If people stop using their vehicles, then they will be more likely to sell the car, and then they will make money in the long run. If the trend continues, fewer and fewer people will use their money to buy cars. Clearly, limiting car usage allows people to spend less money.

To conclude, limiting the usage of vehicles as transportation is an extremely good idea because it is better for the environment, it is saer, and it costs people less money.",0
"When humans need help on a problem they can't get around by themselves, they ask for help in the form of advice. And this happens to almost everybody. That one time you had an argument with your best friend so you asked your mom what to do, that was advice. And that other time when you wanted to join the football team but had no idea how so you asked your athletic friend Generic_Name, that was also advice. But have you ever asked multiple people for advice on the same thing? This is actually beneficial because it can help you make a better choice on the problem you are facing. Seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice because it shows different points of views and the person can choose which advice is the most optimal for the problem they are facing.

Seeking out multiple opinions on a problem you are facing can help show different viewpoints of the problem. Everybody is different in the world. We've heard it preached throughout our lives. And asking for advice just proves that more. All over the world each person is experiencing something different, it may be a small difference in reality but the each mind processes it differently. That's why asking multiple people is important. A 14 year-old who went to the nationals in robotics team is going to have a different opinion than an adult who goes to Harvard for engineering. It doesn't mean that one is more important than the other, but it does effect the advice they give. Age is another variable that changes viewpoint. Your grandfather is going to have a different opinion than your friend in high school because of the times they each grew up in. Because everyone has so many different experiences and mindsets, the person asking for advice is going to have to choose which one is the best or even combine some of the them to make the best or most optimal advice for their problem.

Asking for multiple opinions can help the person asking by giving them options to make the most optimal choice needed for the problem they are facing. The best thing about asking multiple people for advice is that you have options. Options to choose from or even combine to make the best choice. You can compare the opinions you got and see which is the best fit for your problem. And if multiple opinions are the same, most likely that is the best option. But opinions can also contradict each other since everyone has a different viewpoint and ideas. So the only thing you can do is choose which is the best. Only you know what strengths and weaknesses you have. It's your problem that you are facing, and only you know what the best option is.

So now you have chosen the best option for you. You beat the problem you where facing with ease because of the help you've gotten. Now your shoulders feel infinitely lighter as you breathe a sigh of relief. The problem which you've had so much trouble with is now gone. The different viewpoints of others and the options you had helped make the best choice for you. And now you realize that seeking multiple opinions on a problem that you are facing isn't such a bad thing and is in fact a great help.",0
"For me a car is very important , because if you have a car you can move to other places that you want . But not only that , if you have an emergency you can go rapidly,or in time . But this is not a facility in all countries and exist much problems with that , for example in Germany the street parking ,driveways and home garages , this are generally forbidden ,new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss. but in Vauban's streets are completly car free , this is so good , but with a limit ,like  except the main thoroughfare , where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

In conclucion:""As a result , 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars , and 57percent sold a car to move here"". And this is in source 1.

In source 2, in some countries exist prblems with traffic in the strees. One example is Paris ,"" 4,000 drivers were fined , according to Reuters ,27peoplehad their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

In Bogota, Colombia one day is celebreted as Car free day , but in once  year occur somthing different , millions of colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work during this day , leaving the streets without traffic jams .

Paks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city , uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad , smooth sidewalks ,  and others , restrictions have dramatically cut traffic . In conclucion the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s .",0
"Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion ?

In fact, these emotional expression are seen in differnet forms for example, if your happy you smile, if your sad you dont smile. There are plenty of different way to show your emotionsand how your feel. There is value to how you feel, act in ways that people see in everyday life. The authrs describles how new technology enables to identify human emotion in life.

Human expression is how your show your emotions to your friends, family, teachers. People express their emotions in many ways. Here is an example, Mona Lisa she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry most of the time. that's how she expressed her emotions.

Dr. Huang did research on peoples emotions and how people showed their emtions in ways, that he did know how people expressed their emtions with how their face looked to see their emotions show. Dr. Huang looked at the painting of Mona Lisa that Da Vinci painted to show Mona Lisa's emotion in the painting to show, how she felt about being in the painting to express how Da Vinci and Mona Lisa both felt the paintg that both of them liked the painting. Da Vinci emotion to paint a picture of Mona Lisa he felt happy, but he also that she was happy about him painting a picture of her being happy, mad.

Stated in Source 2 under ""What'is wrong with the electoral college"" it talkis about how electoris vote for whom which ever candidate they want.

"The ""Face on Mars"" is really not a a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. There is no alien remains or anything like that. It sure does look like a face, but that was merely a coinsidence.

There are many ways to prove this statement. Today, I will only cover a few, though. They are very good points. By the end of this, I think you'll be agreeing with me also.

First of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body. If this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. Absolutely no body found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.

The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now. This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.

The third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest). ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" Garvin says.

In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me.",0
"I believe that the new technology which is called the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea that will help value students in a classroom . The Facial Action Coding System can help determine the way you feeling , reliezes that you might need help on a lesson that you are not comprehending very well , also it knows when something is bothering you .

When on a computer the Facial Action Coding System determines the way you feeling when the computer constructed 3-D face model revolves around all fourty four major muscles in a human face . When you show emotion towards the computer and have a movement of one or more muscles it is called a action unit which helps the com puter bring all your emotions together and be able to seperte them into they percentages . For example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows which means your surprised . Your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips that shows your angry . There many muscles in a human face that has a variety of different ways to show their emotions .

The new technology can also relieze when something is bothering you . For example when your friend ask "" whats wrong ? "" and you say nothing your friend dictated that you were lying so his/her mouth would stretch sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle , the risorius hich means dont lie . Also it can tell when you are putting on a fake smile and actually hurting inside . The computer is actually showing empathy by feeling someone elses emotional state . Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them .

When struggling on a lesson on the computer the Facial Action Coding System will notice . However "" a classroom computer could relieze when a student is becoming confused or bored , then it will modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ."" The same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive - fro video games or video surgery . But also on the other note the new technology couldnt be the best idea due to the fact that some people are going through some stuff and school is a way to clear they mind and going on a computer at school with the new technology would remind them .

"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the authour said Venuse is often referred to as Earth's twin. So well alot of people would think that it means they are the same, wrong as said in the article Venus gets up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the planet's surface and the atmosphere is made up of mostly 97% carbon dioxide that blankets Venus.

The resend Astronomers are fasinated by Venus is because is is the plant most like Earth. They beleive that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. If Venus once had life, and water what could have happened to Venus could happen to Earthso studying Venus could posibale halp us save Earth from having the same fate.

So in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" yes it has its challenges just like everything we do on Earth or in space. Just like in the article it said that the surface of Venus is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, so to solve this challenge the good people at NASA are trying to find something that can withstand the heat and still be able to bild a space shadal out of it.

Introduction:

We can see to simple nudes ayes when some people have the high enthusiams and we can detected if a person are sad, happy, when you talking or with yours expressions to the other people. The people who have enthusiams are the persons who ever have more people in the around whos can help them, so if they see a person sad, they go where him and they try to be happy him again or they asked you how they can help that person, but a person who doesn't have enthusiams they worry about to other people.

People who have enthusiams:

They can to do all whatever they wants, because they are happy.

They can create a grat ideas when they are happy in that moment.

They can help to other person who need help.

They can to be the best in everything.

They can to be happy to ther people who are tired or sad.

People who doesn't have enthusiams:

If you doesn't have enthusiams, you can not do anything.

How you can help to other person if you doesn't have your own enthusiams.

If your enthusiams is bad, don't be alone.

If you don't have enthusiams, you doesn't wants to do anything.

Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

No, I'm not agree whith him because, if we failure and failure everytime again, so we enthusiams go to down, but if we failure just one time and the next time we are more preparate, is almost same that happen to me the day nobvemver 19, 2018,

that for see the hour from my phone, some people think that I did cheat in the SOL, but I doesn't need do that for pass this SOL.

Conclusion:

The bad enthusiams not just affect one person, that affect to the people who are in the around because if we can transmit cheerfulness to the other person and the other size the coin, other people can transmit the bad enthusiams I think so, so the person who have a good enthusiams they try to help to the other people. Winston Churchill with that he said, I understand that thing; That person whos failure and failure, are the person more strong because each failure they return more strongers and they do the best job.

"Phones & Driving

Cell phones one of the most important technology in today world since cells phones have been created almost no one can do without them. Phones are so important to us that we need them in case of emergency. family or friends that are away from us or international from a different county. we all known that driving is one of the number one cause of death.

While driving is a privilege we have today. When you text and drive you not only put yourself at risk you put innocent drives at stake. Just recently the state of Georgia ban the use of cell phones while driving. I believe there is no text back to that person that can not wait. We should take life precious. in the UK cell phones are banned. I believe all call phones should be banned. Recently researchers have come up with a way of using our phones while driving.

In order to do that they have came up with advanced vehicle that we can make phone calls with touching our phones by using the aux. I hope as we move forward in life people can learn from each other's mistakes. Texting while driving is the worst thing to do you can . loose your privilege or suspended license. Even worse you could kill someone while walking. So the question is does it really worth texting while driving?",0
"I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It also doesnt do any harm, so i think ther shouldnt be an agument on why they shouldnt event ths type of technology. Making these types of inventions can even be helpful not just for the Facil Action Coding system but to many other inventions. They are becoming more advanced in technology and are capable of developing more interesting inventions. Many students also some times have problems trying to fihure out what there feeling or to tell some one how they feel. I agree that the Facial Action coding System is valuable and ould be used for goods.

This technology can be used for many thing and in a very good way. For ecample like the author wrote in the article. They can make changes in many things by seeing the emotions in a sudents face. For example in some ones homwork, in a book there reading. By reading there face expresions they can use that technology for the good of a person. They can find new things and make changes. So the things that are boring or sad or anything that is making someone not be intirested in something make them more intiresting. In my opinion people that make stories or news papr aricles want there work to be seen and get many reviews. So by figuring out what some one is really intirested in is a good way know. Many people like new developments. If this type of work becomes more advanced it could be something good.

In my opinion i think its valuable. It does no harm to some one and it heps so some one could be under stood and helped. This technology could be used for many thing. Its also once more a new invention and helpful for many more. It also is a very intiresing in the way it works. Just because it was well diveloped to know how the human face works and the changes it makesevery time it has a diffirent expression. Thats why i think this development is very valuable.",0
"Have ever thought a problem can take you to do your best. knowing that you made a mistake or have a problem come to you can eather ruin your plans or take you to do the best. Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"". A problem can present in any ocattion but is inportant for you to not give up to keep trying and to make that problem a new chance were you can try something new.

Being able to show your solving a skill can also help you in any ocattion. If you are able to show that you can solve anything and take risk to solve tha problem that can be an inportant step for you to take and try to flip that problem to something good . Show your skill show that you can keep trying and try your best to solve that problem wich can take a long time to do but by showing things can also help you in your future.

studys show that solving a problem can increase your brain knowledge imagene if in stead of solving a problem you can flip it into a good thing, and also help in the future. a problem can come from diffirent situation and from different topics which can help increase your knowlegde in that certain topic what happens if you try something new and it fails that can also can make you or can break you. it can break you in the form that you stop tryingand give up or it cna make you if you dont let that problem take control of you and you take your time to solve it or turn it into chance.

do your best to solve that problem or take that chance or turn it into a lelarning process that you know you try ur best and you know you took your time to solve that problem and you can have that expirience in your mind and you know you learn a lot from thatt chance that was once a problem but knowing is a learning expirience. All that you learn can help you in the future. and I agree with what duke ellington said a problem can be a chnce of learning.

making a mistake or having a problem fail can teach you a lot of thing were you can learn from your failing expirience it can sometimes ruin your expirience but at the end of the day you learn from that mistake. That problem can present in any ocattion or time. having the powers to turn that problem into a chance of learning.",0
"My claim towards this topic on whether or not to use this computer technology in a classroom would be effective or not. In my opinion yes, im all for this technology in a classroom. Mainly because i know as a student i do get bored and i do get tired when im reading an article and if this technology can read our facial recognition and change the lesson based on how us as students are feeling on the scale of facial recongnition. This article states that the computers in schools now wouldnt be able to handle this sort of technology, so what my main question is. How much would it cost schools to get a hold of this kind of technology and especially this amount of technology. When schools globaly are already asking the government for more money as a whole alot of schools have already asked for over 5 referendums in less than 4 years, in that case how could schools afford 3,000 computers with this technology inside it.

If we were to switch to this facial recognition software why couldnt us students jut all be homecshooled by a computer beause as Dr. Huang states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" so why would we need a(n) human intructor if this technology can act as a human instructor and change lesson plans according to how we are feeling based on facial expressions. In conclusion all i would like to say is that yes this technology could be very effective in schools in the future if schools had the mony to buy all this technololgy. An even bigger point I would like to make is why have school, if this technology can act as a human instructor?",0
"Dear, State Senator

Hi, State Senator my name is PROPER_NAME and i think you should stay with Electoral College because the Electoral college is a process not a place. Stated in paragraph 1 it says "" The founding fathers establsihed it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualifed citzens"". So in my owns i think what was stated means it should be a tradition and it should stay as a tradition in the American culture. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. With that being said that is just like saying you are choosing a president by the most popular votes. In paragraph ten it says under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.To me in the passage the bset argument for you to keep the Electoral College is the electoral college is less work than having everyone vote and round it off for a president to be elected. But i'm not going to waste any of your time anymore just know Electoral College would be the best choice for you to choose

From:PROPER_NAME",0
"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced delegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definite winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winnertakeall"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the candidates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swinglike tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.",0
"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students shouldn't use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldn't be doing and that won't help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they aren't learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and won't be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they don't do well on because they haven't been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they can't do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students don't need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they don't need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they won't need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they won't be doing their work they will be doing other things that aren't importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldn't be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldn't be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school.",0
"Do you think individuality create a unique way to be your own of life style? Some say individuality make a specific way to achieve goals being yourself. I'm definitely argue with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement about individuality because your own style of works,Nobody tell us what to change , freely to choose your way of thinking.

First, your own style of works. For example, my dear sister "" Generic_Name"" yesterday, she got a phone call.

I was with her, when she answered the phone call , it's was the teacher saying if my sister "" Generic_Name "" would come at her college, because she was the only one at her class to got a higher score for doing the project with her own creativity and unique steps at the project without following the steps that her teacher being teaching daily at the whole classroom. The teacher told my sister it's a good way to do something with your own ideas without the fear that would be good or bad its just exploring your ability to making great works being yourself .This explain my sister for being the only one to did the project with her own way got the most higher grade.

Second, Nobody tell us what to change. For example,

my sister "" Generic_Name"", every night, she tell me, how I need to brush my hair correctly, she thinks the hair need a proper care and treatment to brushing the hair . I dont like to do at her way because I feel her way to brush it's more slowly than mine own way to brush my hair, so every night she got mad with me because never use her style to brush the hair. I always said to her, I like to brush my hair at my way and my sister can not tell me to change my way at brushing my beautiful hair. This explain, my sister, don't need to get mad for doing the opposite the she wants to do, I got my style and nobody has to tell me what to change at doing any activity.

Third, Freely to choose your way of thinking. for examples. ""Generic_Name "" my sister told to my mom , if she can participate at the "" project of making a novel "" in her school , so my mom let to her participate. She thinks that would be the winner for being the most iconic novel might be existed in the world, so she starting to writing it down, each content at her novel but she dont need a examples of novel because she got her own style to write down, she say her novel would be a entertainment novel because her way to thinks it's different at the other types of novels, her novel will be a her own creativity and passion to make the novel the next most read novel in the world. This explain,free thinking its discovering a new person.

Individuality, makes us special to achieve it goals. style of works different than anyone else. we don't need to someone to tell us what to change. Being free to choosing thoughts it 's s a perfect way to express it with the real world .some says individuality is to be a selfish behavior for doing the things at ours own ways but Individuality it's just a sense of life to find your own way to work. In the future individuality would be the secret tool to reach different goals.",0
"Dear, State senator Voting is a public thing that happens every fourth year when a President is resining or cannidating for a second run. People all around the United States vote for a President they think can run the country the best. I think it's not fair that our votes are getting thrown away, and not even looked at. bradford Plumer said that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational source 2 paragraph 14, and i think that is true. I think we should Bannish the Electoral College because it is a old process, unfair to Americans, and can lead to disasters.

The Electoral College is a very outdated process. Dont you think we should use a new one? The electoral College has been use since the 13 colonies, and has been ignoring the public ever since. I think its only fair if we have a part in the president election. Also, if we could change it to popular vote, more people would be intact with politics. Bradford Plumer says that ""the election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. source 2 paragraph 12. I agree with him because the Electoral College is very old and can break at any time. I think its time that we change that and start fresh.

America's saying is ""home of the free, land of the brave"" well its not free if we cant vote for our president we want, and the government does it for us. Bradford Plumer says that the electoral college is unfair to voters, and candidates because of the winner takes all system source 2 paragraph 13. The winner takes all system is states choosing if the are going to pick a republican president or demicrate president. Lastly. it is unfair to us. We have no power against the government, and our votes mean nothing to them.

The Electoral College can also lead to disasters! rivets can flood the streets if they dont like the legislators choice, and that can lead to deaths. Secondly, shootings could start to occurring around the states, and can get out of hand. Inicent silvilians can get hurt for no reasons. Lastly, there can be financial crashes, and everyone around the states could go in dept.

to sum up my letter i think the electoral College should be bannished for good. You have heard that it is a old process and can lead to falure, it is unfair to americans, and it can lead to disasters all around the country.",0
"The meaning of a democracy is that the people vote for their leader or president. The electoral college denys that right and that is why the state senator should change that. Not only do the popular votes barley make a difference but, with the electoral college in play the representatives vote for our president, not us. If popular vote was the way the president was elected the elections would be fair.

To start with, how can we live in a democracy were the people do not pick their own president but, some representatives we suposadly chose can. If we were alowed to choose our own president then we could at least feel right in what we chose and not what the representatives did. according to

Bradford Plumer the electoral college is unfair due to the winner take all method which basically states that if you are a big state and have many representatives then you will have a majority of a say when it comes to voting. I it were only up to the people to vote then every single vote would count more towards the winning president and not towards the representatives. If the electoral college would keep on then even if the popular vote went for one of the representatives the electoral vote would decide the actual winner.

Also, acorrding to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implys that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected. Most Americans do not know that they are voting for representatives who in turn vote for the president making this unfair. Thats just another reason why the electoral college is outdated and not needed.

Although the popular vote system is a little bias and favors the president the citizens like the most, it can also prove more effected for the fact that there will always be a winner no matter what. The popular votes system cant be represented by most states like the electoral college does but, it does have the vote of the entire country as opposed to a few states with more representatives.

In conclusion, the senator should change the voting system for many reasons. First, the popular vote is more reliable and there will always be a winner. Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personaly vote for theyre president rather than someone else to do it for you. These simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.",0
"Some people say working alone is more benifical. Well I think working in a group is more benifical.

My first reason is it keeps you away from boredom. It keeps you away from starring at a wall for hours. And it keeps you away from sleeping in a class room. Its more helpful having someone to raise and boost your energy and being the confident person you are. Now days in a classroom were haveing 60 percentr on students being unsure about there answers and being unsure if they should even speak up. Being in a group helps you raise your voice. Manny Adult and students are suffering boredom and thats not healthy. Talking to your peers and being around people more keeps you away from depression. Making your self feel more confident about yourself shows who you really are its like the next step to being a risk taker. My second reason is you can talk and discuss with your group about your project or work together. Its more faster being in a group where you can actually discuss about your thoughts and idea and feeling more confident than ever. Having a partner check it look togerther for any mistake or errors. My final reason is you save lots of time for yourself. And not everyone is right. But creating these ideas from yourself and your group could make something turn out to be unthinkable. Being in a group makes your mind grow and learn new things and ideas from other people. Your having a good time with your friends and if not you meet new people that may become friends with you. You want to talk and move around and meet new people getting out. Not being shy or denying yourself wrong. Being in a group is like your bring peace in a table. I belive that everyone should try new things being in a groups and its okay if your wrong because there is no right answer. Being in a group helps you become bigger and bold about yourself your trusting you self and your classmate. I believe working in a group is more benificaial rather than working along cecking your self and thinking if your rong and feeling unpositive about yourself.",0
"Car usage could easily help detoriate waste and pollutants from our air. If every person in the United States were to limit the use of their driving then most of he worlds pollution and green house gases would vanish. In Beijing, China, it's a common, everyday procedure to put on a medical mask to prevent ""dirty"" air into getting into their lungs with ease. If every single person on the planet were to reduce the amount of driving they had to do, if they started driving hybrids, if they began using cars that ran on vegetable oil or electricity, we could practically erase the damage that has been done to our ecosystem via pollution. It would take a while but I don't see why we couldn't attempt to make Earth a little greener.

According to paragraph 41 in article four, a quote, stated ""A study last year found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" meaning that they had either carpooled or used a friendlier alternative to cars and the gaseous fumes they emit. If people were to start riding bicycles we could drastically change not only our planet and the ecosystem, but we could also fix our health.

Most American's rarely exercise and it's a common thing to be mildly obese to extremely and deadly overweight. We could easily begin a new generation of healthier teens and adults if we were to introduce healthy lifestyle habits whilst still at a young age.

Article one shows that a new study that has been developed has created a new town with fewer drivers and everything is available when you walk outside. Vauban, Germany has led a research team to see the impact that driving motor vehicles has on society. There are 5,500 people living in this ""rectangular square"" mile that ""may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life"" if they could do it, why can't we?

Paris has temporarily banned driving due to smog. Article 2 has said that their French citizens would be fined 22euro 31 for drivingbeing in a car! Congestion had died down around 60% and it's said that the smog had rivaled Beijing, China, known as ""one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Diesel fuel has a large role to play in this, but maybe if one day we could find other resources to fuel our driving needs, we could restore this beautiful planet and its atmosphere to what it once was.",0
"Arguments over whether we should limit car-usage has been an importamt topic through out the world. Even though there are some set backs, the advantages are tempting.

in Germany, almost everyone has learned to do with less usage of cars since 2006. I thinnnk the twon should be able to do as they please. passengers cars are responsible fpr 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.

In paris, driving has been suspended due to growing amounts of fog. after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Cold nights and war days caused the warmwer layer of air to trap car emissions. If the driving roads are not safe, then they should create a driving ban on people for safety.

I strongly belive that we should limit out car use in order to achieve safety for the people. We can take buses that can hold 30 people instead of each person driving their own car. that would make a huge differnce.",0
"Many people dream of buying a new car by the time the reach the age of sixteen once they finally obtain their license. However, in recent years, a large population of people have stopped feeling the need for private transportation and have sold their cars and trucks or moved to areas where things such as public transportation, biking, and walking are cheaper and more efficient alternatives. Choosing not to own a passenger car can lead to less emissions, save space, and improve the quality of life for citizens in a city.

Transportation is the second largest contributor to greenhouse gases, behind only power generation. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Source 1 Limiting the use of private transportation will bring about cleaner skies, greatly reduce the amount and effects of acid rain, and impede upon the progression of the destruction of our ozone layer in the atmosphere that helps to protect us from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. If more and more people in not only developed but also developing countries choose to become car and truckfree, ""where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities,"" Source 1 our Earth will become a much cleaner and healthier place for young and old alike.

There have been many previous efforts to make cities denser and more walking and bikingfriendly, but most of these advances have been limited by or even been put to a stop because of the need for an excessive amount of large roads and space for parking for the huge amount of private passenger cars found in cities and suburbs today. Reducing the amount of cars on the road can free up space for more important things such as housing, shops, financial districts, and even parks or other recreational areas that can be more inviting to citizens rather than the loud hustle and bustle of highdensity roadways. ""'All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,' said David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America, a fastgrowing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States... who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars."" Source 1 Removing the problem of private transportation from city planning and development can greatly increase the quality and efficiency of our city's layouts.

Many people consider New York City to be the ""city that never sleeps,"" because of the loud and constant noise of outside motors revving and angry drivers honking their car horns. New York City, along with many other large cities, face this problem which has been growing since the late 1940's. With the rise of reduced dependency on private means of transportation, places such as the more populated areas of New York may finally be able to take a nap. ""BOGOTA, Colombia... millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Source 3 Noise isn't the only quality of life improvement that citizens of large cities can experience with a drop of the amount of cars on streets and boulevards. Levels of smog, a mixture of smoke a fog caused by excessive amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the air, would also start to fall down to a point where they would barely be noticable. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city... Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The fog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Source 2 Limiting car use can be extremely beneficial if executed correctly. These benefits include a cleaner city, more efficient uses of space, and an increase in the desirability of larger cities and towns. Overall, a reduction to the amount of private vehicles on the road would be a great improvement for a multitude or reasons.",0
"The Face isn't made by aliens becuase it is just a natural land form, and if we look at pictures taken be our spacecraft is will show us it is not a face. Also the Face was proven to be just a land form by Global Surveyor when it took a new picture in 2001.

The face is also not alian made becuase if it was there would be more then just a face to prove that they were there. Also scientists can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size to see if the picture was right and that it's not a face. Also another thing is the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa that are landforms common around the American West.

Another reason it could have looked like a face is the took a picture of the Face on Mars and its located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. Witch means the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Witch could have messed up the picture. The new picture was taken on Nevertheless April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Before they got that picture they had to do alot of hard work.

Heres what the did, Mission controllers prepared to look again. they said Its not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, its hard work. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. They just dont pass over the Face very often. The first time they took the pickture it wasnt that good of a picture. This is what happened before they got the good photo. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. It was a better photo then the first one taken by the viking but it had a glare and wasn't as good as the second one.

This is why the face isn't an alien artifact, and it is also why it is not being looked at alot and observed. The Face is just a natural landform on mars that is sorta like a butte or mesalandform found around the American West. It alo kinda looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Middle Butte a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Thats why Its not Alien it is just a natural land form.",0
"The Electoral College is a system where elected senators from each state vote for the next president of the United States Of America. But doesn't voting belong to the hands of the citizens? Citizens of the U.S should pick their president without the hand of the state senators that would vote for the other canidate. The state of Wyoming representing 500000 voters have as much say as the senators from California with 35 million people and more. The Electoral College is a flawed sytem in which the senators not the people choose their next president.

The Electoral College should have less say in the next presidency because of the ""Winner take all"" system in which candidates don't spend time in areas they know have no chance at getting their votes. These canidates would only then go for the Swing states and not even try to get the votes of the other states. Leaving the fate of the next president in the hand of a few is not a reasonable act. Although few citizens of America know the complex working of the government and need the knowledge of the senators to get the right vote. The goverment should know that giving the right to vote to only a few people is not a good solution to the problem. The problem lies where the senators not the people vote for their next prisent.

The prime example of a canidant that won the popular vote but loss on the Electoral vote was Al Gore. George W. Bush won the election with only 5 Electoral while Gore won the peoples votes. Only 5 people were able to change the presidental election, this is exacly why people should be the one to vote for their presidents not the other way around. This flawed system brings out the question that ""are we really voting for the president or our senators?"" it is the latter. The peoples votes aren't for the president but really is for the senators that then vote for the president. But the senators would then only vote for the president that would only for for the mijority of the people not the minority.

Electoral College should be replaced with a popular vote system that allows for more equal voting amoung the people instead of a few. The Electoral College should be instead a advice System giving people an idea of who to choose and tell the people what the president is looking for and what to do. With this new system presidents would actually go for the states that they knew wouldn't have voted for them before and at least try to get a few votes out of the smalle places that would vote for them. All in all the Electoral College has many flaws and holes, but in the end the people should the ones to vote their president not the senators.",0
"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods.

A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA.

The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race.",0
"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced delegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definite winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winnertakeall"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the candidates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swinglike tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.",0
"Venus has many dangeres thing that could kill people and the auther explaings how it is still worth explaring it. It is really hot and has almost no air that we can breath. NASA is trying to figer a way that they can study venus without getting hurt.

He says that Venus could have been just like earth with life living on it. It has simmiler rock formashen, valleys, mountains, and craters such as earth does from where water used to be. It now has vary dangres atmosphere it is like 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater then it is on are planet. Venus almost has a 97 percent caedon dixide blankets, it has the hottes surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus has geology and wather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

NASA is working on possible solution to the hostile conditions of venus and they would allow scientists to float above the fray. It would be a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so milews above venuses landscapeing. It would be it by hovering over venus it would avoid all the unfriendly ground counditions, by staying up and out of their way. At 30 puls miles away it should be around 170 degrees fahrenheit and the air pressure would be close to that of a sea level on earth. Soler power would be good and the radiation would not exceed earth levels.

Even if we were able to have a ship hover over the planet we would be able to see much becouse most froms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. It is rendering standerdforms of photography and videography, reachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. NASA is working on other approaches to study venus like some electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested. Other way is looking at technology from the past like the mechanical computers, they were frist envisioned in the 1800s, it played an important role in the 1940s throw ww2. They calculation by using gears and levers and do not required electronics unlike modern computers that enormously poweful, flexible , and quick, but is more delicate when it come to extreme physical conditions.

Venus is a very dangers planet but is it alos a really intersing planet that can have really hight timpers and bad storms and earthquakes. NASA is hopefully going to find a way to inter the planet one day if they have to use silicon cardbide or older computers they will one day be able to explor Venus and see what it has in store for them.",0
"The author of this story uses a lot of information about exploring Venus. He writes about the history of Venus and the dangers of travling there too. But, is it really worth sending people to Venus if they are just going to die ?

The author talks about the dangers of going to Venus very well. He inculdes that the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. He also says the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. That type of environment would crush a submarine, which are meant to dive into the deepest parts of earth's oceans. The one thing the author does well is he covers all of the dangers of going to Venus. Even thought he is trying to convince the reader that it's a good idea to explore Venus.

The one thing the author does not write about is how much all of this is going to cost and who is going to pay for it. The one thing people care about is money and if the author is trying to convince someone to make this happen they are most likely going to want to know how much this would cost. If people who pay their taxes are going to end up paying for this I don't think people would be to happy. Most likely a trip to Venus would cost more than when NASA went to the moon. Other than the author not talking about the cost, he covers everything else pretty well.

The author also talks about how NASA is trying to figure out new projects and using old porjects to get to Venus. He says that scientists are making simplified electronics made of silicon carbide to be tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in these conditions. I think the reason the author gives you this information is because he wants you to think that there are other people who want to explore Venus as well. Another project the author talks about is scientists looking back at old technology called mechanical computers. He says that these mechanical computers would be better than the new computers because the new ones are very frail and can't be under rough conditions. But the old computers are not frail and can be put into rough conditons, such as Venus's rough conditions.

The author supports his idea about going to Venus very well. His idea would be better though if he added some information about how much it would cost to go to Venus. He did have a lot of infromation on the new projects that NASA was developing and how dangerous it was to travel to Venus as well. Other than not having the costs this was a pretty intresting article and well developed.",0
"Since World War II we have been heavily dependent on the modern day transpotation: the car. Some say the car is an innovative and convienent method of transportation, while others say that it will be the end of the environment. As the evidence indicates, there are advantages to limiting car usage.

Dissenters of the idea claim to say that limiting car usage will negatively impact the car industry, but it doesn't. Limiting car usage doesn't mean that people will have to stop buying cars; it simply means that they will have to find a different method of transporation. Source 2 says that in Paris on certain days motorist, who had an odd or even license plate number, had to leave their cars at home and find an alternative method of transportation. Does the evidence demonstrate an impact to car companies? Did they have a financial deficit due to their lack of buyers? The answer is simple: no, because they didn't ban the use of cars. Also, car companies can well benefit from places that limit car usage but allow hybrid cars; this allows for an increase in revenue. Most car companies in today's society model hybrid cars that run on primarily electricity and gas. In Paris, they made exceptions ""for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers (Source 2)"". These exceptions actually promote the buying of hybrid cars! This will boost the economic profit of the car companies, not damage it. Limiting car usage does not affect car companies, but instead supports it.

The limitation of car usage betters the environment. Cars emit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere faster than they can be removed. This causes health problems in living organisms and pollution of ecosystems. Cars are liable for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in areas in the U.S. as Source 1 states. People are playing with the balance of nature and if its not fixed then humans are as good as dead; this is why the implementation of limiting car usage benefits people. The effects of this can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, whose goal is to reduce smog and promote alternative transporation (Source 3), and Paris, where intense smog covered the enitre city: ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.(Source 2)"" The source explains that cold nights and warm days trapped in car emissions and after a few days of reducing car usage the air cleared up. This shows the effectiveness of the limiations of car usage.

The limiting of cars also boosts community wellness. The people who experienced this regulation had positive views on the matter and even on rainy days they participated! Bogota, Colombia has gone into its third year of banning cars and the turnouts of the pariticipation were large, with two other Colombian cities joining and municipal authorities from other countries to view the event (Source 3). The evidence show that limiting cars wasn't opposed by the people, in fact, other countries were wanting to get in on the action. This limiting of car usage really cuts down on traffic congestion and new community projects have been established to ease the transition to alternative transportation. Heidrun Walter, mentioned in Source 1, syas that when she had her car she always tense and stressed and is happy with the change. The source also mentions that the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor (Source 1)."" This shows that the limitation of car usage greatly enchances the wellness of the community and promotes a safe and stress-free environment for the people.

In summation, the limitation of car usage doesn't negatively impact car companies, but instead increases hybrid car sale revenue, echances community wellness, betters the environment. The things that can be accomplished with this regulation only has benefits for everyone. With this in mind, why not implement this ideal in order to better the lives of not only this generation but the future leaders of the world?",0
"Talking to three people will help anybody with something they cant decide on. If somebody says one thing and then you say another. The only solution is to only get help from one other person. So that you could have three including yourself. Their is no reason to have only ask one person something because when anyone ask three people something, its bound to have a answer because its three people and there is an odd number of people.

Studies have shown, when anybody ask more than one person a for advice then it gets solved quickly. Whenever there is two people and they gives you advice that you disagree with. All everyone should do is just ask one more person for advice. After that then you will finally know just side with the person that likes your idea. The next time you you want advice from one person remember this.

One person is greater than two. If anyone were to ask a group of three. With you making four, there will most likely be a tie. Lets say you pick blue and one other person goes with you, that remains two more and they like orange. that means there is a tie.

So basically what i'm am saying is that. When a group of people have a even number there is a impossible chance of solving witch person to go with for advice. Okay when you talk to one person then it could be helpful to take advice from them. But its a better idea to ask two because now there is another side to just that one earlier.

If your friend were to get in a fight. And you were right there. The principle isn't just going to take you side. They will see if the other kid could tell there side, so that they will have more than one side of the story. The next time you ever take advice from one person remember to just ask one more.",0
"Cars have been the main focus of developement for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society.

While cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the

New York Times

Company, cars are the ""second largest source of America's emission"" proving how much we rely on cars (source 4 paragraph 34).She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes while Europe is only responsible for 12(source 1 paragraph 5). 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the

Chicago Tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog (source 2 paragraph 10). Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.

Even though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the

Seattle Times , speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" in the city of Bogota (source 3 paragraph 27). Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bycycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation.

With the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty (source 3 paragraph 20). The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them (source 2 paragraph 14). This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.

Many nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come.",0
"The concept of the automobile in the early 1900s was enough to make others pursue the dream of having one. As car dealerships made better looking, faster, high performance cars, the more people wanted them. After World War II when cars became inexpensive, more and more people had them. But it's also becoming an issue. Recently, that trend is going down.

To begin, the car industry has been at an all time high. We're making cars so fuel efficient, it almost seems impossible. We even have hybrid cars, which run on electric and fuel (respectively). But with all of the cars out there, especially in the US, the pollution in nations and our own cities are at an all time high. China's air pollution is the worst in the world. Nations have been taking the initiative to partially ban car use for a few days. Paris for instance, banned motorists with even-numbered license plates from using their vehicles, switching to odd-numbered the following day.

Furthermore, we have Bogota, Colombia who took a different approach to the rising air pollution. Instead of what Paris did, they banned automobile use in general, for one day. Buses and taxis still ran, but private vehicles did not. This seeminly little feat over time has done wonders on the city. More and more cities, including nations, are beginning this practice.

To sum things up, we see that there are advantages (and of course disadvantages) to limiting car use. Companies may lose money if they transport items. But as a whole, it's only a few days. Or even one day, that no one drives a vehicle. It's a perfect time to ride a bike, and lower air pollution in a city.",0
"Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called ""Face"" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows. The ""Face"" is just an ordinary landform on Mars with unusual shadowing because of recent pictures taken of the natural landform, scientific evidence, and measurements taken.

To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. ""On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degreesto center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel inv the best 1976 Viking photo."" (p. 10). This shows that NASA has gotten a clear photo of the Face with much better photo quality then the first time iit was photographed.

As discussed before, NASA has taken a new and better quality photo of the Face in Cydonia. Using our scientific equiopment at NASA, we have proven just how much better the resolution is on the new phototgraph taken is. """"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gtround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" (p. 11). This quote from the article shows it has been scientifically proven there is no markings, indentations, or objects around the Face that would make it be a human skull.

Finally, NASA compares the Face landform with similar landforms on Earth in America. The scientist compares the Face with a landform called a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West. ""it reminds me of Middle Buttle in the Snake ZRiver Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" (p. 12). This uses a real-life example and measurements to compare the two landforms. The scientist Garvin poinmts out that both landforms--the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and the Face on Mars-- are around the height and shape,

On the contrary, some people believe that the face is """"Bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists"" (p. 5). In defense, NASA has scientifically proven the ""Face"" is just a natural landform created on Mars. ""What the picture really shows is the Martien equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" (p.12).

In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.",0
"Cars, they are used for many purposes including taking the kids to school, going to work and many others but have you ever thought about what vehicals are doing to the Earth or the people on the Earth? Well cars have to use gasoline or diesel to move that is just how it always has been but these fossil fuels are actually poluting the Earth, and making the air we breath very ""smoggy."" If we can limit our usage of our cars there can be many advantages including having cleaner air to breath, more excercize, and also less expenses. Humans could survive without cars if we give it a shot.

Take a deap breath outside, what do you smell? Listen, what do you hear? Cars honking? A loud engine of a diesel truck? Well most likely because cars have been around for a long time and without them how would people get to work or school, but have you ever thought about what these cars and trucks are letting out of their tailpipe? Source 1 ""In German Suburb,Life goes on with cars"" says that there has been ""a huge imediment to curent efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" these greenhouse gases are clogging up our atmosphere and our air. Without cars air pollution would go down emensly, and would be a big advantage. In Paris there has been ""near-record polution""- ""Paris bans driving to to smog"" By: Robert Duffer.

Now a days when people hear excersize they would run and hide but it's mostly because we have all these vehicals that can take us places without the dreaded walking or running. Americans today can get a cheeseburger in minutes through a drive-thru in their vehicals but have you ever imagined life without a car, in Columbia on "" The Day without Cars"" as said in "" Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata By: Andrew Salsky ""Columbians hiked, biked, skated...to work during a car free day"" and even ""parks and sports centers also have smooth sidewalks"" which has ""dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants...have cropped up"" The car free day has made excersize a little easier, and now with smoother side walks and more sports centers people in Columbia can have more opportunities to take a walk.

When you have a car its not unusual to have to go get gas atleast once every one or two weeks, but these expenses can pile up when you have to buy gas or even the oil change of your vehical. What if you get in a accident will your insurence cover it, cars and trucks take a lot of expenses and it can be hard to pay for it all and when President Obama gave the ambitious goal to lesson the greenhouse emissions last week ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" -""The End of Car Culture"" By:Elisabeth Rosenthal. The usage of less cars can has a great advantage on your wallet.

As said in ""The End of Car Culture""- ""Pedestian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and piblic transportation traffic are woven into a commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected networkto save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Limiting your car usage can have many advantages including making Earth's air cleaner, creating a way for more excersize, and also less expences. Cars will still be in use but maybe we can limit it to only a few.",0
"There are many reasons that limted car usage would be good. 70 percent off familys in french and swiss boarder do not own car they dont need them.""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". 57 percent of people sold there car and moved there.""All development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"".

In paris they banned cars for a little will because of the pollution making smog. Any one found driving would be fined. Almost 4000 people were fined for driving on that monday and 27 people has their cars impounded for thier reaction. After 5 days the the smog started to leave and they could see beijing, china which are the most polluted citys in the world. In france 67 percent of cars are diesel.

In colombia on car free day people kiked, biked, skated or took the bus on car free day. It was the third start year they had to ban cars to reduce all the smog and people who didnt listen had to pay 25 dollar fine. For the first time other places joined the event to help with the pollution."" These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"".

Obama's studys show that more and more americans are not driving and not getting there licenses as each year goes by. And they wonder has america passed peak driving. On april 2013 the number of miles driven per person went down 9 percent.

in conclusion it is better to not drive for a little than to drive to help pollution from getting really bad.",0
"Did you know that NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was the first spacecraft of any sort to see the mysterious face on Mars? This mysterious face was first discovered in 2001. I am a scientist from NASA that has been researching this unusual, shadowy likeness of a human face since about twenty-five years ago. My name is Ellie. I get all sorts of questions and opinions asked to me about the human face. Some people say that they do not think that it's real, and that NASA is just making it up to get more people to notice us. Well, that would be wrong, considereing that we have pictures to prove it. We know that the face is just a natural landform because the pictures show it to be almost equivalent of a mesa or butte, and it looks identical to the Middle Butte in Idaho.

We know that the shadowy likeness of a human face is just a natural landform because is looks almost equivalent to a mesa or a butte. We have many questions asking things like, "" How do you know that aliens didn't form it?""

and, ""How do we know that this picture is not photoshopped to get NASA more commercial business?"" The answer is we don't know exactly what formed it, but our research shows that it is a natural landform. First of all, pictures do not lie, especially that camera that we took it with. We took the picture with using a camera's absolute maximum resolution. In this camera, ""each pixel in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"" as we know from our research. Also, the mysterious landform that we captured looked like a mesa or a butte- landforms that are common around the American Midwest. to add to that, the Face takes the same shape as a lava dome and the same height. Not only does the face look almost equivalent to a mesa or butte, but it also looks almost identical to most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Another reson that we know that the Face is just a natural landorm is because it looks almost identical to a landform is Idaho. People send NASA emails, and letters asking questions. One of our most states opinions is,"" Just because it looks like a landform on Earth doesn't mean anything. Things might be different there and there could be aliens there."" Yes that could be true, but our research and pictures also prove it to be wrong. The first snapshot of the Face was captured was a long time ago. Since then our camera and photo quality has improved. Today we now have way better pictures of the Face than we did over twenty-five years ago. That means that we can see the landform better and look at the different characteristics of the landform. Then after we looked at the characteristics, we found that the Face had almost the exact same size, shape, quality of a landform in Idaho, United States. Also, one of our researches stated the definition of the Middle Butte. He stated,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face in Mars. Thousands of web surfers had been anxiously waiting for images for NASA to be revealed. Until one day we released the pictures. As we knew already, web surfers found that there was ""no alien monument after all"" as we know from our research. We also released how we took the picture. We had a picture taken by a camera on board MGS, but it had to peer through clouds. Then people started saying statements like,"" Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze."" Once again, that cannot be true because the characteristics and qualities of the Face look exactly like a part of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Now you have been proved wrong, and I hope all your questions were answered about the Face, or at least the questions that were stated in the article. we have done a lot of research on this mysterious human face, and found that it was not created by aliens. We know that it is a landform because it looks like a mesa or a butte, and it looks almost identical to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Therefore, this Face is just a landform.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, It has come to my, as well as many other's attention, that the presidential election is something that could potentially have disastrous outcomes. You, and many politicians like yourself, have been using a system called the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter have been suggesting to demolish for years now. Personally, I find it quite alarming that although this process has been with us for all of this time, we have found the flaws yet still continue to take the risks. This is not simply about picking a president anymore, this is about the freedom of America.

All in all, the Electoral College at face value seems like a good idea for choosing a winner. It seems to make sense that we would choose electorss who the president trusts that would elect him president, but when you think about it, something feels rather off. First of all, the general public places their ballots in the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates. In reality, however, they are voting for their electorss instead. Most people who vote are unaware of this factor, and the lack of information pertaining to it is unsettling. Not only that, but the electorss are not chosen by the people. Does this not contradict ""By the people, for the people?"" Where exactly do these people fit in?

Furthermore, the electorss cannot always be trusted with voting for their respective candidates. This is something referred to as the disaster factor. While most who are picked by the candidate themself are trustworthy, electorss are people who are not in office, therefore may not be as trusting. Electors are an uncertain factor and in some complex cases, even two slates for electorss can be sent which could create a hectic mess. If you are going to vote for a president who you wish to win, and your vote goes to an electors that won't come through, it takes all of the power away from the people and places it right back into the state's hands.

Another thing to consider when pondering the validity of this process is the potential of a tie with electorsal voting. In this case, the election would be in the power of the House of Representatives, and the representatives from each state would decide the winner. We have had many opportunities for a tie during the elections, one even being the difference of 5,559 in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii. The problem with this is the loss of power within the nation. Once again, the people will no longer have a say in the voting and the energy it took them to decide on a candidate and go out to vote will be for virtually nothing. The people will no longer be represented. If something like this were to happen to our country, surely people from every state would be outraged.

Now, you may be thinking to yourself, why should I be worried? Sure, it is unlikely to get a tie in the electorsal votes. However, something as huge as deciding the leader of this country should not have even a single flaw in it. Horrible and unexpected things happen everyday, why couldn't we get a tie as well? Now, the main problem with getting rid of the Electoral College is the possibility of runoff elections. In defense of this, the Electoral College is the main reason that we have runoff elections in the first place. It prevents people in certain areas from voting because they feel as if they will have no say in the final result. Even if people still voted for the fun of it, it was only because of chance or political preference. With an election by popular vote, the chances of a runoff election would be significantly lower as people would realize the power they had in deciding it.

As you finish reading this, I ask you to consider all of the points I have made. I am certain that choosing to elect by popular vote would have more benefits than sticking to the old and flawed plan, the Electoral College. Endless proof points to the conclusion that this theory is correct, as the process of picking electorss to elect the president is redundant and confusing. Finally, with all of the things that could go wrong, using a new system would be one step forward in making our nation even greater.",0
"The use of technology to read the emotional exppressions of students in a classroom is valuablefor many reasons. Emotions are a strange thing, and not evryone is going undertsatnd you just based off of your looks. There is something called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that classifies our six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disqust,fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and they rely on the muscles in the face to expose it all. All of this came from the relaization that no one knows exactly the expression on the painting ""The Mona Lisa""'s face.

Some have observed the face so much, they can just tell how you're feeling.

Like, in fact if someone close to me were feeling some type of way, I would be able to tell based off of their face expression unless it's ""just their face"".

Not everyone is the same because ""most human contact and/or communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication"" which is stated from the text. Technology has helped alot though in this, especially researchers, psychologists and most likely scientists.

In conclusion, The Mona Lisa painting face expression isn't unknown anylonger. A group of researchers, scientists and whoever else may it be got together to solve this mystery whether it be with a computer, or looking through books. And maybe through this I could pay more attention to face expressions since it's that easy.",0
"The story talks about how computer can recognize emotions by on our face. Dr. Huang made a computer that recognize Mona Lisa's face that she is mostly happy. People can recognize emotions but not guarateed while computer is guarateed. In next paragraph I will put few edivence to support the claim.

""The process begins when then computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet, Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" """"A classroom compter could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.""

Therefore, compter can recognize people when they are happy or sad. Even people can hide their emotions from people but not computer. I think it will help us to make others feel better when they are sad and they won't admit that they are sad.",0
"The wheel was the first step that took society into the making of the mobile car. Today millions of cars are made each year to help humans transport around the cities and streets around the world. Every vehicle that is powered by gasoline emits carbon dioxide, this gas is very harmful for the environment, it causes the ozone later to slowly dissolve and it also causes acid rains. Traffic jams is one of the many effects of having too many cars in a certain populated area. Debt has also been an influential part in the quantity of cars around the globe. Car usage and production should be drastically reduced to ensure a better future for all living things in the Planet Earth.

Furthermore, Global warming has slowly made its toll on Earth, most of which has been produced by the Carbon Dioxide gases in the atmosphere, this gas is a mayor green house gas. Over the years cars have been more extensively used and have a great percentage in world contamination, As stated in article 1 paragraph 5 ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states"". This being, if car production and usage are reduced, Earth will have positive reactions to this change. The levels of global warming will also be reduced all around, this will help us conserve our north and south poles for a longer period of time, keeping safe all the animals related to that area like penguinzs and polar bears.

In addition, Traffic jams arent the most pleasant place to be, due to the fact that they're unpredictable and in most cases highly annoying. Information from passage 2 paragraph 14 states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"", this was due to oderly assigning days in which certain cars with certain license plates can drive through the cities of france. Less congestion means higher percent in mobility all around, this can greatly effect a 3 hour traffic jam to a simple 20 minute ride. Coming and going from places can be a brease, and this will also facilitate extra time for other potential activities. Reducing car usage and congestion can also lead to less accidents and car crashes.

Moreover, Leasing or buying a new car can come heavy on the pocket. Financial debt has been trounced ever since a currency started, debt is unpredictable sometimes and can happen to any individual. Having the latest model of a car can be a luxury only some can afford, the individuals who try and cant afford it ussually end up in debt, as reinforced in article 4 paragraph 32 ""Cash Strapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway"". Ussually some individuals ""bite more than they can chew"" and this can harm not only one indivual, but the economy as a whole. Reducing the mayor debt that can come from car leasing can improve a counrtys economy and benift milliones of individuals.

Concluding, many reasons show society to reduce the usage of cars. One being that gasoline and petrolium powered cars can contaminate the planet Earth, melt our poles, destroy the ozone layer and cause harmful weather effects. Also, the reduction of cars can lead to the decongestion of cities in which indiviuals can more easily and freely move around adding time for them to use as they like. Lastly, the economy can have a mayor boost if car reduction and usage from leasing can occur. In conclusion, the reduction of car usage and production is a great benefit for every individual who lives on Earth, and can lead to many great outcomes that will help members of society enjoy a better life style and have a safer future.",0
"I dont like becuase the student forget all information of the year in the vacations. Teachers or educators feel that the summer because students do not retain information.

I thick when the student have a spring breack or summer vacation we need study in vacatio for not forget all information, we take in the year of the school. Is necessary to be ready to next year. we need take care for not fall the clases.

The teacher well be ready to very year cause sometime the students well be ready for start the year. I think the students they need prepare every year after the summer or other vacation.

Is not bad have vacation in the year because all time study is no good, because the maind no have a relax, the maind need to distract in other thing.

I am not good student but a try to get one is so dificult for me cuse I'm not speak englihs good, but this is not scuse for not study in spring break or in summer, this is for every day to bad studen to good student. nothing is impossible to go better to better.",0
"Is setting a good example by your own bahvior the best way to influence other people, or are there better ways to influence others? Examples are not the main thing to influence other is just a way to say what you really mean. You have to show them what you are traying to explain, what you want them to know about you and things you have done. The best and better ways to influence others would be a good speech, trustworthy, and actions.

First, speech have been always a way to tell people what you form thinking, what you want to achieve, speech always influence people, people got influence by speeches, when they hear their owns needs or just when the speaker talk about good things like a better country, better education, and jobs. They kind of like it and get atracted to it

Second, trustworthy are good ways to influence people, is a way to gain people to trust in you, When a person tried to influence you want that those words to be true, when people says the truth there are alway be people that will get inspired and influence to say what they think or just to say the truth.

Finally; action, action have been the best way to influence people, when people make the rigth thing and theirs action show their achievement, and shoe people what they have done for them and for the society, people get influence by their goods action. There is when the people get influence and they just want the right things.

Examples are not the main thing to influence other, examples is just a step to say what you really mean. when you want to influence somebody there are better way to make that and the best and better ways to influence them would be a speech, trustworthy, and actions; however, examples are always needed in there to make something credible.

"Phones & Driving

In my honest opinion about phone's and driving they do not go together at because both you have to use full attention on when using especially with how things are now and days. It's really dangerous when doing it driving a car because cars are this big built mobile that if you get into a crash and risk your life and or money for insurance on it. Now I think you could balance it between Phone and driving if your good at that like at a red light maybe take a quick glance and it see what it is and then back to driving or get a car that can pick up phone calls.

Now with phones people are so attracted to phones now they can't even walk straight without bumping into people now is it bad to use phones no I don't think it is but when driving is a different story you are putting your life a risk with using a phone. You are putting other peoples life's at risk with doing that too.

When it comes to cars you need your full attention when driving a car everything needs to be sharp because there is dangerous things everywhere so you need to be aware of that when driving so that nothing bad happens. You can't do that when you're on a phone because you're taking away your senses from driving.

I don't think it is a good idea at all to do it unless you know what you're doing and have a car that can pick up phone calls and does not take your time away from driving on the road and therefore can keep you safe and everyone else around and get to your destination safely.",0
"Do you ever find yourself in a tough situation and in need of advice? Well you're not alone, almost everyone needs help at one point or another. Some people ask for multiple opinions when they need advice. I think this is a great idea because you can get multiple views on a topic,you won't have to worry about bias and it gives you different options on how to solve your problem.

To begin with, asking more than one person for advice means you will receive several different views on a topic. This is important when it comes to getting advice because you want to be able to make the best decision possible. For example, if you have a serious health issue arise in your life you might go to more than one doctor or specialist to make sure you're getting the right diagnosis and treatment. Even if you're not having health issues it never hurts to get different views to assist you in making the best choice. Always take these different views into consideration when making your final decision!

Additionally, getting multiple opinions means you won't have to worry about bias. When asking for advice or for someones opinion you don't want to ask just one person and end up getting a bias opinion. So, reaching out to more than one person almost eliminates the chances of that happening. When asking for advice I personally always ask people who are going to help me make the best decision and not someone who is going to give an opinion based on how they feel about the topic. Bias is hard to detect and sometimes it might even feel impossible,it can be confusing too. Just take your time and don't rush yourself when making decisions.

Lastly, you'll have many different options to choose from. This is so important, because then you won't have to feel stuck. For example, if you were to loose your job you would want another job or career to ""fall back on"" or in other words have a back up plan. Without another option you might feel confused or even lost. When making a decision the last thing anyone wants is to have all of those other emotions that's another reason have multiple options is important.

In conclusion, having multiple options,not receiving bias and, seeing different point of views are all reasons I believe it's a good idea to ask for multiple opinions when asking for advice and making a decision. Everyone will ask for advice at least one time so, when you do keep these tips in mind to help you make the best decision possible.",0
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

BuzzMaven Labs, says ""(He) came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Also, a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text and now she probably lives with that on her shoulders everyday now.

There really isn't much more to say other than drive safely and don't be on your phone! Make good decisions, don't drink and drive or anything like that.",0
"I think they should go by popular vote ! beacuse it gives people a chance to vote for the right thing or what they think is right .

So thats a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy .

It happend in 2000, when gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

obama recevied 61.7 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney .... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely ....

nixon in 1986 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the elections .

there  is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the vote cast;that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electroral college, which invariably produces a clear winner....

knowing their vote will have no effect ,they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote ...!",0
"Aliens and natural lanforms are both explanations to describe the Face on Mars. Some people believe that the Face was made by marsians or ""aliens"", but then there are also some that believe it is a natural landform. But I have information to prove that it's just a natural lanform.

Twenty five years ago, NASA had took a photo of what looked like a human face. A couple of days later NASA released the photo the the public and people started to describe it as ""Face on Mars"". On April 5, 1998, Micheal Malin and his MOC took a photo that was 10 times sharper than the oringinal. That showed to prove that it is anatural landform.

Some may beleive that the Face on Mars was created by alien, but there is proof that shows it is just a natural landmark. There is probably still scientist out there researching to find better proof. But it all comes down to what do you believe?",0
"Science. Scientific. Fact.

These are the words you should have going through your mind as you wonder about the Mars landform, found by NASA's

Viking 1; The face. The pharaoh. The man on Mars. However, there are some who...Wish to believe.

To these folks, it is also the face. The

Alien. Martian on mars. These, are the people who we call conspiracy theorists. Conspiracy theorists are nothing more than mere people who wish to emphasize something and twist it up to make it, of course, a conspiracy. These said theorists want to change the perspective and point of view via others, and themselves as well.

However, fact cannot be contained.

When it comes to the face on Mars, as previously explained, there is indeed, fact over opinion. In many aspects, not to mention. Landforms, shadows, and shading galore. In pictures, the face seems to contain basic details to give t the ""person"" type of vibe off. However, there is just one problem.

With the face being known as looking human, there are details still missing. Such as, the rest of the body. There would possibly be an outline of something more around the face, or where a body may be. We cannot go down and literally dig on Mars, thereore pictures were, or are the nex t big thing.

There is a lot of shadowing going around on Mars. The thick clouds, the different angles of rays of light shoning through.

This leads us to our final conclusion. The face is a landform. With the precise shadowing and the shape of some sort of facial stucture, who would know what to think. Blaming conspiracy theorists is not a preferred move, however, the theorists may forget to use fact. I believe, fact is that the face is a mere landform. An artwork of space.

Some, however, wish to believe. Maybe, we should let them.",0
"This essay is going to talk about the ""Facial Action Coding System."" This article is called "" Making Mona Lisa Smile."" And is written by Nick D'Alto. The (FACS) would be good in classrooms.

This coding could be good for students and teachers. So lets say we do get this in classrooms, then the robot could tell if someone is having a bad day, or needs more help on something, just by reading their faces. Then the teacher would maybe help the student more or ask whats wrong, and get the student some kinda help.

If someone has an IEP the robot could tell the teacher that the student needs more help on this on subject. The robot could possible help the student understand it. If the student stil doesnt understand the problem or the subject, the robot could go and get him/her and say to them "" So and so needs your help on this problem or on this subject."" And the teacher would go help them.

Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and and go roge and start herting people. Well if that happended then their would be someone on stand by to turn off the robot and start working on him. So the robot could get back as fast as he could. Well what if that person is sick one day and the robot goes beserk. Then we will have a second person on stand by.

The robot would be good in the classromms. This Coding could be good for students and teachers. If someone has an IEP, the robot could tell the teacher that the studnet needs more help than the other students. Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and go roge and start herting perople. This could be very good for the class room.",0

"Netiquette is a term used to describe the proper etiquette and behavior expected from individuals when communicating and interacting with others online.  It involves adhering to certain rules and guidelines to ensure that online communication is respectful, courteous, and effective. Some examples of netiquette include using appropriate language and avoiding offensive or discriminatory language, avoiding all caps and excessive use of exclamation marks (as it can come across as shouting), being mindful of other people's time when sending emails or messages, respecting others' privacy and not sharing their personal information without their consent, and refraining from spamming or sending unsolicited messages. Netiquette is important as it helps to create a positive and respectful online environment, and ensures that people are able to communicate effectively and productively with each other online.  By following netiquette guidelines, individuals can also avoid misunderstandings, conflicts, and potentially harmful or offensive behavior. ",1
"Chuq von Rospach is a well-known author and speaker on the topic of netiquette (network etiquette).  In his writing, he has suggested a number of guidelines for good online behavior.  Here are some of his suggestions:Respect others: This means treating other people with respect and avoiding insults, flaming, or other forms of aggressive or hurtful behavior. Be concise: When posting messages online, try to be brief and to the point.  Avoid rambling or going off-topic. Stay on topic: When participating in online discussions, try to keep your contributions relevant to the topic at hand. Use appropriate language: Avoid using profanity or other offensive language, and be mindful of the fact that people from different backgrounds and cultures may be reading your posts. Be aware of privacy issues: Respect people's privacy by not sharing personal information about them without their consent.

"Advocates of net neutrality argue that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without discrimination or preference given to any particular website or online service.  Specifically, they argue that internet service providers (ISPs) should not be allowed to block, slow down, or otherwise manipulate internet traffic based on the content or source of that traffic. Here are some of the key arguments made by advocates of net neutrality:Protecting free speech: Net neutrality ensures that all voices on the internet have an equal opportunity to be heard.  If ISPs are allowed to block or slow down certain websites or services, this could restrict the ability of some individuals or groups to communicate online. Promoting innovation: Without net neutrality, ISPs could potentially favor their own products or services over those of their competitors.  This could stifle innovation and limit consumer choice. Preventing discrimination: Net neutrality ensures that all internet traffic is treated equally, regardless of the content, source, or destination of that traffic.  This prevents ISPs from engaging in discriminatory practices that could harm certain groups or individuals. Supporting small businesses: Net neutrality ensures that small businesses have an equal opportunity to reach customers online.  Without net neutrality, larger companies could potentially pay ISPs for faster internet access, giving them an unfair advantage over smaller competitors. Overall, advocates of net neutrality argue that this principle is essential for protecting free speech, promoting innovation, preventing discrimination, and supporting a level playing field for all online businesses and individuals.

"Newsgroups emerged in the early days of the internet as a way for people to communicate and share information with each other.  The development of newsgroups can be traced back to the 1970s, when the first email systems were created.  At that time, email was used primarily by academics and researchers, who used it to share information and collaborate on projects. In the late 1970s, a new communication protocol called Usenet was developed, which allowed people to post and read messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups.  Usenet was decentralized, meaning that anyone with an internet connection could participate in discussions and post messages in newsgroups on a wide range of topics. As the internet grew in popularity in the 1990s, so did the number of people using newsgroups.  At their peak, there were tens of thousands of newsgroups covering a wide range of topics, from politics and religion to sports and entertainment.  Some newsgroups were moderated by volunteers who ensured that discussions remained civil and on-topic, while others were unmoderated and often became heated and contentious. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of newsgroups began to wane as other forms of online communication, such as social media and instant messaging, emerged.  However, newsgroups continue to exist today, albeit with much smaller user bases than in their heyday.  Many newsgroups have migrated to web forums or email discussion lists, but the basic idea of public discussion forums where people can share information and ideas lives on. ",1
"Netnews, also known as Usenet, is a distributed online discussion system that allows users to read and post messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups.  Each newsgroup is dedicated to a specific topic, and users can browse, search, and participate in discussions related to that topic.  Here are the key features and structures of netnews and newsgroups:Hierarchy: Newsgroups are organized into a hierarchical structure that starts with major categories such as ""comp"" for computer-related discussions, ""sci"" for science-related discussions, ""soc"" for social discussions, and ""rec"" for recreational discussions.  Each major category is further divided into subcategories that reflect more specific topics. Message posting: Users can post messages to newsgroups by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to a news server.  The message is then distributed to all servers that subscribe to that particular newsgroup. Message threading: Netnews uses a threading system that groups related messages together in a tree-like structure.  Users can easily follow the conversation by viewing messages in the order they were posted and seeing how they relate to each other. Subscription: Users can subscribe to newsgroups that interest them, and their newsreader software will download all new messages in those newsgroups automatically. Moderation: Some newsgroups are moderated by volunteers who review messages before they are posted to ensure they are relevant and appropriate for the newsgroup's topic.  Moderators can also remove messages that violate the group's rules. Archives: Netnews messages are archived on news servers, and users can search through archives to find old messages or topics of interest. Distribution: Netnews messages are distributed across a network of news servers, which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users. In summary, netnews and newsgroups offer a decentralized, distributed system for online discussion and information sharing, with a hierarchical structure, message threading, subscriptions, and archives.  While netnews and newsgroups have been largely superseded by other online communication platforms, they remain an important part of the early history of the internet and online communities. ",1
"Netnews, or Usenet, is a distributed system for exchanging news and information in the form of messages posted to newsgroups.  The system is decentralized, meaning that there is no central server or authority that controls it.  Instead, messages are distributed across a network of interconnected servers, which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users.  Here's how the distribution and reading of netnews works:Posting a message: Users can post messages to a newsgroup by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to their local news server.  The message is then propagated to other servers that subscribe to the newsgroup, until it reaches all servers in the network. Replication and synchronization: Each news server stores a copy of all messages it receives, and periodically synchronizes with other servers to exchange new messages and updates.  This ensures that all servers have the same set of messages, and that users can access the latest messages from any server in the network. Reading messages: Users can browse newsgroups and read messages using their newsreader software.  The software retrieves messages from their local news server, and can also retrieve messages from other servers in the network if the local server does not have a copy of a particular message. Message threading: Netnews uses a threading system to group related messages together in a tree-like structure, based on their subject and message ID.  This makes it easy for users to follow a conversation or track the evolution of a discussion over time. Archiving: Messages are typically archived on news servers, and can be accessed by users even after they have been removed from their local server or the server they were originally posted to.  This allows users to search for and access older messages and discussions. Overall, the distribution and reading of netnews is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that relies on the synchronization and replication of messages across a network of servers.  This allows users to access a wide range of topics and discussions from anywhere in the network, while also ensuring that messages are distributed and stored redundantly to prevent loss or corruption.

"The idea of networks has been around for centuries, as people have always sought ways to connect with each other over long distances.  However, the modern computer network as we know it today began to take shape in the mid-20th century. In the 1950s, computers were large, expensive, and rare machines that were primarily used by governments, large corporations, and academic institutions.  These computers were often housed in large rooms or buildings and were operated by trained technicians. One of the earliest computer networks was the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) system, which was developed in the late 1950s by the United States Air Force.  The SAGE system was designed to provide early warning of potential air attacks by the Soviet Union.  It used a network of interconnected computers to track incoming enemy aircraft and coordinate defensive responses. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense developed the ARPANET, which was the first wide-area network to use packet switching.  The ARPANET was initially designed as a way for researchers at different universities and research institutions to share computing resources and collaborate on research projects. Over the years, computer networks evolved and became more sophisticated, eventually leading to the creation of the World Wide Web in the 1990s.  Today, networks are an essential part of our daily lives, connecting people and devices all over the world and enabling us to access information and services instantly from almost anywhere. ",1
"The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model that describes the communication process between computing systems.  It is composed of seven layers, each of which defines a specific function in the communication process.  The layers are:Physical layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw data between devices using physical connections like cables, wires, or radio signals.  It defines the electrical and physical specifications for the connection. Data link layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data between devices on the same physical network.  It defines how data is organized into frames for transmission and how errors are detected and corrected. Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing data between different networks.  It determines the optimal path for data to travel and uses protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) to transmit data between networks. Transport layer: This layer provides reliable, end-to-end communication between devices.  It breaks down data into smaller packets for transmission and ensures that they are received correctly at the other end. Session layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between devices.  It allows applications on different devices to establish a communication session and manage the exchange of data. Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for data representation and encryption.  It transforms data into a format that can be understood by the application layer and encrypts it for secure transmission. Application layer: This layer provides services to end-users, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.  It defines the protocols and formats used by applications to communicate with each other. The OSI model is a reference model and does not specify any particular protocol or technology.  However, it provides a common framework that helps network designers and developers to understand the various functions and interactions between different layers of the network. ",1
"NAS stands for Network-Attached Storage.  It refers to a storage device that is connected to a network and allows multiple users and devices to access and share files and data over that network.  NAS devices typically have their own operating systems and can provide a wide range of features such as file sharing, backup and recovery, media streaming, and remote access. NAS devices can be used in both home and business settings to centralize and manage data storage across multiple devices and users.  They are often used as a more cost-effective and flexible alternative to traditional file servers, which require dedicated hardware and IT support.  NAS devices can range in size from small, single-drive units to large enterprise-level systems with multiple drives and advanced features. ",1
"A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network that provides block-level access to data storage.  In a SAN, storage devices such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and other storage appliances are connected to servers through a series of switches and/or hubs. SANs are designed to provide high-speed, reliable access to large amounts of data, and are often used in enterprise environments where large amounts of data need to be stored and accessed by multiple servers and applications.  SANs provide centralized storage management, which allows administrators to allocate storage resources to servers and applications as needed. SANs typically use Fibre Channel or iSCSI protocols to connect storage devices to the network.  Fibre Channel is a high-speed, dedicated network technology that provides very low latency and high reliability.  iSCSI, on the other hand, is an IP-based protocol that allows storage devices to be connected to the network using standard Ethernet connections. SANs can provide a number of benefits, including increased performance, scalability, and availability of data.  They are often used in data centers and other large-scale IT environments to provide high-performance storage for critical applications and data. ",1
"Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that typically focuses on a future dystopian society dominated by advanced technology and corporate control.

"Neuroprosthetics is a field of study that involves developing devices that can replace or restore the function of the nervous system.  These devices are designed to interface directly with the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves and can be used to restore movement, sensation, or other functions that may have been lost due to injury or disease. At Duke University, researchers have been working on developing advanced neuroprosthetics that can help people with spinal cord injuries regain movement and mobility.  One of the key areas of focus has been on developing brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that can translate brain activity into movement. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers at Duke University demonstrated that a monkey with a spinal cord injury was able to regain the ability to walk with the help of a brain-controlled robotic exoskeleton.  The monkey had electrodes implanted in its brain that were able to decode signals related to movement and translate them into commands that controlled the robotic exoskeleton. The researchers also used a wireless connection to send feedback from the exoskeleton back to the monkey's brain, which allowed it to adjust its movements in real-time.  This approach has the potential to enable people with spinal cord injuries to regain movement and independence. Overall, the research carried out at Duke University and other institutions in the field of neuroprosthetics is aimed at developing new and innovative approaches to restoring function and improving the quality of life for people with neurological disorders or injuries.

"Integers are typically stored in memory as binary digits, or ""bits,"" which are either a 0 or a 1.  The size of the integer (i. e. , the number of bits used to represent it) can vary depending on the programming language and the computer architecture being used. In most modern computers, integers are typically stored using a fixed number of bits, such as 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, or 64 bits.  The number of bits used to represent an integer determines its range of possible values.  For example, an 8-bit integer can represent values between 0 and 255, while a 32-bit integer can represent values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. When an integer is stored in memory, it is typically stored as a binary representation of the integer's value using a fixed number of bits.  The most significant bit (MSB) represents the sign of the integer (positive or negative), while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of the integer. For example, consider the 8-bit integer -23.  In binary, this value is represented as 11101001.  The leftmost bit (1) represents the sign (negative), while the remaining 7 bits (1101001) represent the magnitude of the integer (23).  When this value is stored in memory, the computer will reserve 8 bits of memory and store the binary value 11101001 at the corresponding memory address. ",1
"Floating point numbers are typically stored in memory using a standardized format, such as the IEEE 754 standard.  This format uses a combination of a sign bit, an exponent, and a mantissa to represent the value of the floating point number. The sign bit indicates whether the value is positive or negative.  It is represented using a single bit, with 0 indicating a positive value and 1 indicating a negative value. The exponent represents the power of 2 by which the mantissa should be multiplied.  It is represented using a fixed number of bits, which depends on the specific floating point format being used.  For example, in single-precision floating point format (which uses 32 bits), the exponent is represented using 8 bits. The mantissa represents the significant digits of the floating point number.  It is also represented using a fixed number of bits, which depends on the specific floating point format being used.  In single-precision floating point format, the mantissa is represented using 23 bits. To store a floating point number in memory, the computer first converts the number to the standardized floating point format, using the appropriate number of bits for the sign, exponent, and mantissa.  The resulting binary representation is then stored in memory at a specific memory address. When a program needs to use the floating point number, it reads the binary representation from memory, converts it back to the original floating point value, and performs the necessary calculations.

"In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.  To illustrate this concept with an example, we can use the Microsoft Windows Dialog Box. A dialog box is a graphical user interface element that displays information to the user and prompts them for a response.  In Microsoft Windows, a dialog box is implemented as a class, which we can call the DialogBox class. Now, let's suppose we want to create a new type of dialog box called a ColorPickerDialogBox that allows the user to pick a color.  We can use inheritance to create this new class based on the DialogBox class. The ColorPickerDialogBox class will inherit all the properties and methods of the DialogBox class, such as the ability to display text, buttons, and input fields.  However, the ColorPickerDialogBox class will also have its own unique properties and methods that are specific to picking colors, such as a color palette and color preview box. By using inheritance, we can avoid duplicating code and make our program more efficient and easier to maintain.  We can also create more specialized classes that build upon existing classes, making our code more modular and extensible. ",1
"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows different objects to be treated as if they were the same type.  It allows code to be more flexible and reusable by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably. To illustrate this concept with an example, let's consider a program that deals with different shapes, such as circles, squares, and triangles.  Each shape has its own unique properties and methods, such as its size, color, and the ability to calculate its perimeter. Now, let's suppose we want to create a method that takes a shape object as input and calculates its perimeter.  We can use polymorphism to create a single method that works for all types of shapes, rather than creating separate methods for each shape. ",1

"An ontology is a formal, explicit description of concepts and their relationships within a particular domain or area of knowledge.  It defines the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities that exist in that domain, as well as the rules governing their behavior and interactions. In other words, an ontology is a structured way of representing knowledge and information, and it can be used to support a wide range of applications and systems, such as data integration, knowledge management, semantic search, and artificial intelligence. Ontologies can be developed using various formalisms and languages, such as RDF, OWL, and UML, and they can be designed for different purposes and domains, such as biology, medicine, finance, and engineering. ",1
"The implementation of an ontology involves several steps, which may vary depending on the specific ontology language, tools, and application domain.  Here is a general overview of the typical process:Define the ontology scope and requirements: Identify the domain or area of knowledge that the ontology will cover, and specify the purpose and goals of the ontology.  This step involves analyzing existing data sources, documents, and experts' knowledge to determine the relevant concepts, relationships, and properties that need to be represented in the ontology. Design the ontology structure: Decide on the ontology language and modeling approach to use, and create a conceptual model that defines the classes, properties, and relationships in the ontology.  This step involves using ontology editors or modeling tools to define the ontology schema, which may include axioms, constraints, and rules. Implement the ontology schema: Transform the conceptual model into a formal representation in the chosen ontology language, such as OWL or RDF.  This step involves using ontology editors or programming languages to define the ontology's classes, properties, and relationships and to ensure that the ontology conforms to the language syntax and semantics. Populate the ontology with data: Import or generate data that conforms to the ontology schema and annotate the data with ontology terms and concepts.  This step involves using data integration tools or APIs to map the data to the ontology classes and properties and to ensure that the data is consistent and aligned with the ontology's semantics. Validate and evaluate the ontology: Verify the correctness and completeness of the ontology schema and the data, and test the ontology against use cases and scenarios.  This step involves using reasoning engines or validation tools to detect errors, inconsistencies, or ambiguities in the ontology and to ensure that the ontology meets the intended goals and requirements. Deploy and maintain the ontology: Publish the ontology to a repository or server that allows other users or systems to access and use it, and maintain the ontology by updating it with new data or knowledge, refining its schema, or extending its scope. Overall, the implementation of an ontology requires a systematic and iterative approach that involves collaboration between domain experts, ontology designers, and software developers.  It also requires a good understanding of the ontology language and tools, as well as the application domain and data sources. ",1
"Open source software refers to computer software that is distributed with its source code publicly available to anyone to view, modify, and redistribute.  The term ""open source"" refers to the fact that the source code is open to the public, rather than being proprietary or closed.

"RAID stands for ""Redundant Array of Independent Disks"".  It is a technology that involves combining multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit to improve data performance, reliability, or both. There are several different RAID levels, each with its own characteristics and benefits.  The most common RAID levels are:RAID 0: This level stripes data across multiple drives for improved performance, but provides no redundancy.  If one drive fails, all data is lost. RAID 1: This level mirrors data across multiple drives for improved redundancy, but provides no performance benefits.  If one drive fails, data is still accessible from the remaining drives. RAID 5: This level stripes data across multiple drives and also includes parity information, allowing for one drive to fail without data loss. RAID 6: This level is similar to RAID 5, but includes two sets of parity information, allowing for two drives to fail without data loss. Other RAID levels, such as RAID 10, RAID 50, and RAID 60, combine aspects of these basic levels to provide different trade-offs between performance and redundancy. RAID is commonly used in enterprise and server environments to ensure data availability, but can also be used in personal computers for improved performance and data protection. ",1
"Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a product, device, or system to understand how it was designed and how it works.  It involves taking apart the object and examining its components and behavior to determine its structure, function, and operation.  The goal of reverse engineering is to gain insights into how a product or system works in order to replicate, modify, or improve upon it. Reverse engineering is often used in the fields of engineering, computer science, and manufacturing.  In engineering, reverse engineering can be used to understand the design of a product or system that was created by another engineer or company.

"RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a technology that uses radio waves to wirelessly transmit data from a tag or label attached to an object to a reader.  RFID technology can be classified into two types: passive RFID and active RFID. Passive RFID tags or labels do not have their own power source and rely on the power transmitted from the RFID reader to send their information.  When the RFID reader emits a signal, the passive RFID tag or label receives the signal and uses the power to transmit its information back to the reader.  Passive RFID tags are typically used for tracking inventory, managing supply chains, and tracking assets. Active RFID tags or labels, on the other hand, have their own power source and can transmit data independently of an RFID reader.  These tags use batteries or other power sources to broadcast a signal to the reader.  Active RFID tags are often used for tracking high-value assets, such as shipping containers or vehicles, or for tracking people in environments like hospitals or warehouses. The main differences between passive and active RFID are their power requirements and the range over which they can operate.  Passive RFID tags are cheaper, smaller, and have a shorter read range than active RFID tags.  Active RFID tags are more expensive, larger, and can have a longer read range.  The choice between passive and active RFID depends on the application and the requirements of the specific use case. ",1

Serial ports are typically labeled as COM ports in Windows systems, and have a standardized set of settings, such as baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits, that must be configured to ensure proper communication between devices. ",1
"The standard for serial transmission is a set of rules and guidelines that specify how data is transmitted over a serial communication channel.  These standards define the physical and electrical characteristics of the communication channel, as well as the format and timing of the data that is transmitted. The most common serial transmission standard is RS-232, which is a standard developed by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) for serial communication between devices.  RS-232 defines the electrical signal levels, timing, and data format for serial communication, including the use of start and stop bits, parity bits, and other control characters. Other serial transmission standards include RS-422, RS-485, and Universal Serial Bus (USB), each with its own set of specifications for electrical characteristics, signaling, and data format.  These standards are used in different applications and industries, depending on the specific requirements for data transmission. In general, serial transmission involves transmitting data one bit at a time over a single communication channel, with each bit representing a binary value of 0 or 1.  The data is transmitted in a specific format, with each transmission including a start bit, data bits, optional parity bit, and stop bit, which enables the receiving device to synchronize and correctly interpret the data being transmitted.  The speed of transmission is measured in baud rate, which represents the number of signal changes per second. ",1

"Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the unsorted part of an array and moving it to the beginning of the array.  The algorithm maintains two subarrays: the sorted subarray, which starts as empty, and the unsorted subarray, which starts as the entire array. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted subarray.  This effectively moves the smallest element to the beginning of the array and expands the sorted subarray by one element.  The algorithm then repeats this process for the remainder of the unsorted subarray until the entire array is sorted. In each step of the algorithm, the smallest element in the unsorted subarray is identified and swapped with the first element in the unsorted subarray.  After four steps, the array is sorted in ascending order. Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large arrays.  However, it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms. ",1
"Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through an array of elements and compares adjacent elements, swapping them if they are in the wrong order.  The algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary, indicating that the array is sorted. In each step of the algorithm, the current element is compared with the next element and swapped if they are in the wrong order.  The algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary, indicating that the array is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large arrays.  However, it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms. ",1
"Quick sort is a widely-used sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array of elements.  The algorithm works by selecting a ""pivot"" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.  The pivot element is then placed between the two subarrays. The partitioning process is repeated recursively on each of the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.  The two subarrays are sorted independently using quick sort. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case and O(n^2) in the worst case.  However, it is generally faster than other sorting algorithms for large arrays due to its efficient use of memory and cache.  It is widely used in practice and is often the sorting algorithm of choice for many programming languages and applications. ",1
"Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.  The algorithm iterates through the array and at each iteration, it takes the current element and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted subarray to the left of it. The algorithm maintains two subarrays: the sorted subarray, which starts as the first element of the array, and the unsorted subarray, which starts as the remaining elements of the array. In each step of the algorithm, the current element in the unsorted subarray is compared with the elements in the sorted subarray until its correct position is found.  The elements in the sorted subarray that are greater than the current element are shifted one position to the right to make room for the current element.  The current element is then inserted into its correct position in the sorted subarray. Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large arrays.  However, it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or for sorting partially sorted arrays.  It is also an efficient algorithm for sorting small datasets, or for use as a sub-routine in more complex algorithms. ",1
"In hash-based sorting algorithms, a hash table is used to store the elements to be sorted.  The keys of the hash table are computed from the values of the elements using a hash function.  The values stored in the hash table can be either the elements themselves, or pointers to the elements. The elements are then sorted by iterating through the hash table and collecting the values in order.  Since hash tables do not maintain any order on their own, the order of the elements collected from the hash table must be determined based on the order of the hash keys.  In some cases, a secondary sorting algorithm may be used to sort the values with the same hash key. One advantage of hash-based sorting algorithms is that they can achieve linear time complexity in the average case, since hash table operations such as insertion and lookup can be performed in constant time on average.  However, the worst-case time complexity is typically higher than other sorting algorithms, since collisions in the hash table can lead to slower performance. ",1

"In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements, where the elements are stored and retrieved based on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.  Think of a stack of plates; you can only remove the top plate, and to add another plate, it must be placed on top. A stack has two main operations: push and pop.  The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while the pop operation removes the most recently added element from the top of the stack.  Other operations on a stack can include peek, which retrieves the most recently added element without removing it, and is_empty, which checks if the stack contains any elements.

The struct or class contains fields or members for storing the node's key value, as well as pointers or references to its left and right child nodes. Memory allocation for binary trees is typically done dynamically using heap memory.  When a new node is created, memory is allocated for the node using a memory allocation function such as malloc() in C or new() in C++.  The allocated memory is then used to store the node's key value and pointers or references to its child nodes. When a node is no longer needed, its memory is freed using a memory deallocation function such as free() in C or delete() in C++.  This helps to avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient use of memory.

"A web server is a software program that runs on a computer and is responsible for serving web content to clients, typically web browsers.  The working of a web server can be explained in the following steps:A client (a web browser) sends a request to the web server for a particular web page or resource, using the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol.  The request typically contains information such as the type of resource requested, the desired encoding, and any other relevant data. The web server receives the request and analyzes it to determine which resource is being requested, and if it is available on the server.  If the resource is not found, the web server will send a ""404 Not Found"" response to the client. If the resource is found, the web server retrieves it and prepares to send it to the client.  This may involve reading the resource from disk, generating it dynamically using server-side scripting languages like PHP, or retrieving it from a database. The web server sends the resource to the client in the form of an HTTP response.  The response typically includes headers that provide metadata about the resource, such as its content type, length, and encoding. The client receives the response and renders the resource to the user, typically by displaying it in a web browser. Throughout this process, the web server may interact with other servers, databases, or services to fulfill the client's request.  For example, the web server might use a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple servers, or it might authenticate the client's identity using a separate authentication server.

"Neurality refers to the concept of neural networks, which are a type of artificial intelligence modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons, that process and transmit information.  Each neuron receives input from multiple other neurons and computes a weighted sum of these inputs.  The neuron then passes this sum through a nonlinear activation function to produce an output, which is then transmitted to other neurons.  This process of computing weighted sums and passing the results through activation functions is repeated multiple times, allowing the neural network to build increasingly complex representations of the input data. Neural networks can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, language translation, and even playing games like chess.

"Hacking refers to the act of accessing computer systems or networks without authorization, and the term ""hacker"" originally referred to someone who was skilled in computer programming and used their skills to solve problems in creative and innovative ways. The first known instance of hacking occurred in 1960, when a group of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) explored the limitations of the institution's computer system.  In the following decades, hacking grew in popularity and became associated with both positive and negative activities. In the 1980s, hackers gained notoriety for their involvement in high-profile computer security breaches, such as the Morris Worm, which affected thousands of computers.  This led to the passage of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the United States in 1986, which made computer hacking a federal crime. Since then, the field of cybersecurity has evolved to protect against hacking and other types of cyberattacks.  However, hacking and hackers continue to pose a threat to computer systems and networks, and both ethical and unethical hacking are still practiced today",1
"The hexadecimal system is a number system with a base of 16.  It is commonly used in computing and digital electronics, as it provides an efficient way to represent binary data.  In the hexadecimal system, each digit can have 16 different values, ranging from 0 to 9 and A to F. The first 10 digits in the hexadecimal system represent the numbers 0 to 9, while the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15.  For example, the number 10 in hexadecimal is represented by the letter A, and the number 15 is represented by the letter F. To convert a hexadecimal number to a decimal number, each digit is multiplied by its corresponding power of 16 and then added together.  For example, the hexadecimal number 3B can be converted to decimal as follows:3B = (3 x 16^1) + (11 x 16^0)= (3 x 16) + (11 x 1)= 48 + 11= 59Similarly, to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number, the number is divided by 16 and the remainder is converted to a hexadecimal digit.  The process is repeated until the quotient becomes zero.  The resulting hexadecimal digits are written in reverse order to obtain the final hexadecimal number. For example, to convert the decimal number 210 to hexadecimal:210 ÷ 16 = 13 with a remainder of 213 ÷ 16 = 0 with a remainder of 13 (which is represented by the letter D)Therefore, 210 in hexadecimal is D2.

"In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is used to efficiently maintain a collection of elements where the priority of each element is determined by its value or some other key. Heaps can be of two types:Max heap: In a max heap, the parent nodes are always greater than or equal to their child nodes.  The maximum element in the heap is always the root node. Min heap: In a min heap, the parent nodes are always smaller than or equal to their child nodes.  The minimum element in the heap is always the root node. A heap is often used in algorithms such as sorting, graph algorithms, and priority queue implementations. The most common operation performed on a heap is insertion, where a new element is added to the heap in a way that maintains the heap property.  The next most common operation is deletion, where the root node is removed from the heap and replaced with another element in a way that also maintains the heap property.  Other common operations on a heap include searching for an element, merging two heaps, and extracting the maximum or minimum element. Heaps have an average time complexity of O(log n) for both insertion and deletion, making them a popular choice for a wide range of applications where efficient and fast access to elements is required.

"In computer science, a hash is a fixed-length string of characters generated by applying a mathematical function or algorithm to a variable-length input data.  The resulting hash value is usually a unique representation of the input data, which is why it is commonly used for data integrity, authentication, and encryption. Hashing is a widely used technique for data storage, indexing, and retrieval.  Hash functions are designed to map variable-length data to a fixed-size hash value in a way that is fast, efficient, and avoids collisions. ",1
"Hashing has many applications in computer science, but two major ones are:Data Storage and Retrieval: Hashing is used for efficient data storage and retrieval in many applications.  Hash tables are widely used data structures that store data in a way that allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.  In a hash table, data elements are stored based on their keys, and a hash function is used to map the keys to an index in an array.  This makes it easy to quickly access a data element given its key, and the time complexity of basic operations like insertions and lookups is typically O(1) on average. Data Authentication and Verification: Hashing is also used for data authentication and verification.  When a hash function is applied to a message or data file, it generates a fixed-length hash value that is unique to the input data.  This makes it possible to verify that the data has not been tampered with or corrupted in any way, as any changes to the input data will result in a different hash value.  Hashing is widely used for password storage, where passwords are hashed and stored in a database, and for digital signatures, where a hash of a document or message is signed to ensure its authenticity and integrity.

"Fiber optics is a technology used in telecommunications and networking that involves the transmission of data and information over thin, flexible glass or plastic fibers.  The fibers use light to transmit signals over long distances, offering high-speed and high-bandwidth communication capabilities. In a fiber optic system, light is generated by a laser or LED and transmitted through the fiber optic cable.  The light travels through the fiber by repeatedly bouncing off the walls of the fiber, which are coated with a highly reflective material.  The light is guided through the fiber by a process called total internal reflection, which allows it to travel over long distances without significant signal loss or degradation. ",1
"The development of optical fiber technology can be traced back to the early 20th century, when scientists and engineers began to explore the use of light to transmit information over long distances. In the 1920s and 1930s, researchers began to investigate the properties of glass and other transparent materials as potential transmission media for light.  They discovered that light could be guided along a thin glass fiber by reflecting off the walls of the fiber, and that this process, called total internal reflection, could be used to transmit information. In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers in the United States and Europe made significant advances in the development of fiber optics technology.  They developed new manufacturing techniques to produce high-quality glass fibers with low attenuation (loss of signal strength), and they developed new methods for connecting fibers together and transmitting light signals over long distances. In the 1970s and 1980s, the development of new types of lasers and other light sources made it possible to transmit signals over much longer distances and at much higher data rates.  This led to the widespread adoption of fiber optic technology in telecommunications and other applications. Today, optical fiber technology is used in a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, networking, medical equipment, and sensing technologies.  It has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information, enabling high-speed data transmission and communication over long distances with unprecedented reliability and efficiency. ",1
"Optical fiber technology offers several advantages over traditional copper-based communication systems, including:High bandwidth: Optical fibers can transmit large amounts of data over long distances at high speeds, making them ideal for high-bandwidth applications such as video streaming, cloud computing, and online gaming. Low attenuation: Optical fibers have low attenuation, which means that they can transmit signals over long distances without significant signal loss or degradation. Immunity to electromagnetic interference: Optical fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference, making them more reliable in high-noise environments. Small size and lightweight: Optical fibers are small and lightweight, making them easy to install and transport. Security: Optical fibers are difficult to tap or intercept, making them more secure than traditional copper-based communication systems. Durability: Optical fibers are highly durable and resistant to damage from moisture, temperature fluctuations, and other environmental factors. Cost-effective: Optical fibers are becoming increasingly cost-effective as the technology becomes more widely adopted and production costs decrease. ",1

Better performance: File servers are designed to handle large amounts of data and provide fast access to files.  This can improve overall system performance, especially in environments where multiple users are accessing files simultaneously. Cost-effective: By centralizing file storage and management, a file server can reduce the need for individual storage devices on each computer in a network.  This can lead to cost savings over time. ",1
"File sharing refers to the process of making files available to other users over a network or the internet.  This can be done in a variety of ways, including through a file server, email attachment, cloud storage service, or peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of network where computers or devices communicate directly with each other, rather than through a central server.  P2P networks are commonly used for file sharing, as they allow users to share files with others without the need for a central file server.  In a P2P network, each user's computer acts as both a client and a server, enabling files to be shared directly between users. In a P2P file sharing network, users can search for and download files from other users who have made those files available for sharing.  Examples of popular P2P file sharing networks include BitTorrent, eDonkey, and Gnutella.  While P2P networks can facilitate fast and efficient file sharing, they can also pose security risks and be used for illegal activities such as copyright infringement. ",1
"BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocol that enables users to share large files over the internet.  The protocol was developed by Bram Cohen in 2001 and has since become one of the most popular P2P file sharing methods on the internet. BitTorrent works by breaking large files into smaller pieces and distributing those pieces across multiple computers on the network.  Users can download and upload different pieces of the file simultaneously, allowing for faster download speeds and more efficient use of network resources. BitTorrent has been used to share a wide variety of files, including movies, music, software, and games.  While the protocol itself is not illegal, it has been associated with copyright infringement and piracy, as users can easily share copyrighted content without permission.  As a result, many countries have taken steps to block or restrict access to BitTorrent and other P2P file sharing networks. ",1

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transferring data over the web, including web pages, images, and other types of files.  While not specifically designed for file transfer, HTTP can be used to transfer files, particularly smaller files. HTTPS (HTTP Secure): A secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data during transfer.  HTTPS is commonly used for secure web connections and is often used for transferring sensitive data. SCP (Secure Copy Protocol): A secure file transfer protocol that uses SSH (Secure Shell) to encrypt data during transfer.  SCP is commonly used for transferring files between Unix/Linux servers. ",1
"File transfer can be implemented in several different ways, depending on the requirements and constraints of the system.  Some common implementations of file transfer include:Client-server file transfer: In this implementation, files are transferred between a client computer and a server computer.  The client sends a request for a file to the server, which then sends the file back to the client.  This is commonly used for file transfer over the internet, such as downloading files from a website. Peer-to-peer file transfer: In this implementation, files are transferred directly between two or more computers on a network, without the need for a centralized server.  Peer-to-peer file transfer is often used for sharing files between individuals or for file sharing networks, such as BitTorrent. Cloud-based file transfer: In this implementation, files are transferred between a local computer and a remote cloud server, which stores and manages the files.  Cloud-based file transfer is commonly used for storing and sharing files online, such as with cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox. Physical media transfer: In this implementation, files are transferred using physical media, such as USB drives or CDs/DVDs.  Physical media transfer is commonly used for transferring large files or for situations where internet access is not available or practical. ",1
"The role of computers in the film industry began in the 1970s with the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI).  At that time, computers were used primarily to generate simple 2D graphics and effects, such as titles and special effects for TV commercials. In the 1980s, the capabilities of computers improved, and they began to be used for more complex 3D graphics and effects in films.  One of the first films to use computer-generated imagery extensively was ""Tron"" (1982), which used CGI to create the film's distinctive digital world. As the technology continued to improve, the use of CGI in films became more widespread, with films like ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and ""The Matrix"" (1999) using advanced CGI to create realistic creatures and special effects. Today, computers play a vital role in nearly every aspect of the film industry, from pre-production to post-production.  They are used to create and edit scripts, design sets and costumes, film and edit footage, and create special effects and visual effects.  Additionally, computers are used for marketing and distribution, such as creating trailers and promoting films on social media and streaming platforms. ",1
"A finite state machine (FSM), also known as a finite automaton, is a mathematical model used to represent a system that can be in one of a finite number of states, and can transition between those states in response to input.  FSMs are used in a variety of applications, including software engineering, circuit design, natural language processing, and many more. An FSM is typically defined by a set of states, a set of inputs, a set of transitions between states, and a set of output actions or behaviors.  The transitions between states are often represented as a directed graph, where each state is a node and each transition is an edge.  The FSM starts in an initial state and transitions between states based on the input it receives.  The output actions or behaviors can be triggered by either the input or the state transition. ",1

"In computer science, a checksum is a value calculated from a set of data, typically a file or a message, used to detect errors that may have occurred during transmission or storage. The checksum is usually a small fixed-size value that is generated using an algorithm, such as the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm.  The algorithm takes the data as input and produces a unique checksum value that is different for each set of data. Checksums are commonly used to verify the integrity of data during transmission or storage.  When a file is transmitted over a network or stored on a disk, its checksum is calculated and transmitted or stored alongside the file.  When the file is received or accessed, the checksum is recalculated and compared to the original checksum.  If the two checksums match, it is assumed that the data has not been corrupted or modified during transmission or storage. Checksums can also be used to detect accidental or intentional changes to data.  If even a single bit of the data is changed, the checksum value will be different, indicating that an error has occurred.  Checksums can be used to detect errors in a wide range of applications, including network protocols, file systems, and databases. ",1

"The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that was widely used to protect data confidentiality in electronic communication and storage systems in the 1970s and 1980s. The DES algorithm works by using a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt data.  The key is used to perform a series of mathematical operations on the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, and the same key is used to reverse the operations and recover the plaintext from the ciphertext.  The key size for DES is 56 bits, and the algorithm uses a block cipher with a fixed block size of 64 bits. Although DES was considered a secure encryption standard for many years, advances in computing power and cryptographic attacks eventually rendered the algorithm vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  As a result, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was adopted as a replacement for DES in the early 2000s.  Despite its obsolescence, DES still remains in use in some legacy systems and applications. ",1
"In computer science, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a network segment that is isolated from the internal network and is exposed to the public internet.  The purpose of a DMZ is to provide a secure location for servers and services that need to be accessible from the internet, such as web servers, email servers, and file transfer servers, while protecting the internal network from external threats. A DMZ is typically implemented by placing a firewall or a router between the internal network and the DMZ.  The firewall is configured to allow traffic from the internet to the DMZ while blocking traffic to the internal network.  This allows external users to access services in the DMZ, while protecting the internal network from attacks that may originate from the internet. However, it's important to note that a DMZ is not a completely secure solution and does not provide full protection against all types of attacks.  Additional security measures such as intrusion detection and prevention systems, strong authentication, and access control policies should be implemented to ensure the security of the DMZ and the internal network.

"A Digital Certificate, also known as a public key certificate, is an electronic document that is used to verify the authenticity of a digital entity, such as a website, server, or person. Digital certificates work by linking a public key to an identity, such as the name of a website or organization.  The certificate is issued by a trusted third party, called a Certificate Authority (CA), who verifies the identity of the entity and signs the certificate with their own digital signature.  This creates a chain of trust, in which a user can trust the entity's identity because they trust the CA that issued the certificate. When a user connects to a website or server that has a digital certificate, their browser or application checks the certificate to ensure that it is valid and issued by a trusted CA.  If the certificate is valid, the user's browser or application can establish a secure connection with the entity using encryption to protect the data that is transmitted between them. Digital certificates are commonly used to secure online transactions, such as online shopping and banking, as well as to protect sensitive data and communications.  They play a crucial role in establishing trust and security on the internet, and are an essential component of many security protocols, such as SSL/TLS. ",1
"Digital Rights Management (DRM) refers to a set of technologies and techniques used to control access to and usage of digital content, such as music, movies, and ebooks.

Critics argue that DRM can be overly restrictive and can interfere with legitimate uses of content, such as fair use or personal backups.  In some cases, DRM can also be circumvented by determined users, which raises questions about its effectiveness as a means of protecting digital content. ",1
"A Digital Signature is a cryptographic technique used to authenticate the integrity and origin of a digital message or document in computer security.  It provides assurance that the message or document has not been altered in transit and that it was signed by the intended signer. Digital signatures are based on a mathematical algorithm that creates a unique digital fingerprint of the message or document, called a hash.  The hash is then encrypted using the signer's private key, which is known only to the signer, to create a digital signature.  The recipient of the message or document can then verify the signature using the signer's public key, which can be obtained from a trusted third party, such as a Certificate Authority. The process of verifying a digital signature involves recreating the hash of the original message or document and comparing it to the decrypted digital signature.  If the two hashes match, then the signature is considered valid and the recipient can be confident that the message or document has not been tampered with and was signed by the intended signer.

"n computing, cache refers to a high-speed data storage layer that stores recently used data and instructions to provide faster access to that data in the future. When data is requested by a program, the computer first checks if the data is available in the cache memory.  If it is, the computer retrieves the data from the cache instead of going to the original source, such as the hard drive or network, which is slower.  This results in faster access to frequently used data, which in turn improves the overall performance of the computer system. Caches can be found in many different parts of a computer system, including the processor, hard drive, and web browser.  They can be either hardware-based, such as a processor cache, or software-based, such as a web browser cache. ",1
"The CPU cache is a small and fast memory storage area located on the processor chip that is used to store frequently used data and instructions.  Its purpose is to speed up the processing time of the CPU by reducing the number of times it needs to access the slower main memory or RAM. When a program requests data or instructions from the main memory, the CPU first checks if the requested data or instruction is present in the cache.  If it is, the CPU retrieves the data from the cache instead of going to the main memory.  This process is much faster because the cache is located on the processor chip and has a much shorter access time than the main memory. ",1
"Disk cache is a mechanism used by computer operating systems to improve disk I/O (input/output) performance. When a program reads data from a disk, the operating system caches the data in memory, so that the next time the program needs to access the same data, it can be retrieved quickly from memory instead of having to read it from the disk again.  Similarly, when a program writes data to a disk, the operating system caches the data in memory and writes it to the disk at a later time when it is more efficient to do so. The disk cache can be either a dedicated portion of RAM or a portion of the hard drive that has been set aside for this purpose.  By caching frequently accessed data in memory, the operating system can reduce the amount of time spent waiting for disk I/O operations, which can improve overall system performance. ",1
"Network cache is a mechanism used to improve network performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user or application, rather than retrieving it repeatedly from a remote server. Network cache can operate at different levels, such as in web browsers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and proxy servers.  For example, web browsers use a cache to store web pages, images, and other resources that are frequently accessed by the user, so that they can be retrieved quickly without having to download them from the internet again.  CDNs use a network of servers located in different regions to cache content, so that users can access it from a server that is geographically closer to them, reducing the latency and improving the performance. Proxy servers also use cache to store frequently accessed content locally, reducing the load on the upstream server and improving the response time for subsequent requests.  This is particularly useful in corporate networks where multiple users access the same content, such as internal web pages, and email attachments. ",1

"Chess has a long history of being used as a benchmark for measuring the capabilities of computers, specifically in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).  Chess is a complex game that requires strategy, foresight, and decision-making, making it a challenging task for computers to master. The first notable example of computer chess was the 1950s when computer scientists began experimenting with programming computers to play chess.  However, it wasn't until the 1970s when the first computer chess tournament was held, and the first commercially available computer chess program, Chess 4. 0, was released. Since then, computer chess has made significant progress, and today, the best computer chess programs can easily defeat even the most skilled human players.  This progress has been driven by advances in hardware and software, as well as improvements in AI techniques such as search algorithms, game tree pruning, and machine learning. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue computer famously defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov in a highly publicized match.  This event marked a significant milestone in computer chess and demonstrated that computers could outperform human players in certain areas. ",1
"Chess has been an important testbed for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) since the earliest days of computing.  The game's complexity and strategic depth make it an ideal domain for exploring the limits of machine intelligence and testing new AI algorithms. One of the key challenges in developing AI systems for chess is the enormous search space of possible moves.  In the game of chess, there are approximately 10^120 possible games, which is many orders of magnitude larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe.  To overcome this challenge, AI researchers have developed a range of techniques, such as alpha-beta pruning, minimax search, and Monte Carlo tree search, to efficiently explore the search space and find good moves. Another challenge in developing AI for chess is representing the game state in a way that is amenable to machine learning.  Historically, this has been done using hand-crafted features that encode various aspects of the game state, such as the relative values of the pieces and the mobility of the pieces.  However, in recent years, deep learning techniques have been used to automatically learn representations of the game state from raw board positions. ",1

"In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.  It defines a set of properties (also known as attributes or fields) and methods that are common to all objects of a certain type. A class provides a way to encapsulate data and functionality, allowing for modular and organized programming.  It defines the behavior and properties of a certain type of object, but does not create any actual objects itself.  Instead, an object is created from a class using a process called instantiation. A class can be thought of as a template or a cookie cutter, while an object is an instance of that template or cookie cutter.  For example, a class called ""Person"" might define attributes such as name, age, and address, and methods such as ""walk"" and ""speak"".  An object created from the Person class would have specific values for those attributes (such as ""John"", 30, and ""123 Main St. ""), and would be able to perform the methods defined in the class. Classes can also inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing for more complex relationships and structures.  This is known as inheritance and is a key feature of OOP. ",1
"Client-server computing is a model of distributed computing where tasks are divided between clients and servers.

It is used to model and analyze complex systems that involve randomness or uncertainty, such as weather patterns, stock prices, and game theory. ",1
"A compiler is a software program that translates source code written in a programming language into machine code, which is a language that computers can understand and execute.  The process of converting source code into machine code is called compilation. The compiler takes the source code, analyzes its syntax and structure, and translates it into an equivalent program in machine code.  The machine code is then executed by the computer's processor, performing the operations specified in the source code. Compilers are essential tools for software development, as they allow programmers to write code in high-level programming languages and then translate that code into machine code that can be executed on a variety of computer systems.  This enables developers to write code that is more abstract and expressive, without having to worry about the specifics of the underlying hardware. Compilers are also used to optimize code for performance, by generating machine code that is more efficient and faster than code written by humans.  Additionally, compilers can detect errors and bugs in the source code during the compilation process, helping to identify and fix issues before the program is run. There are many different compilers available for different programming languages, and some languages even have multiple compilers that can be used depending on the specific needs of the programmer. ",1
"The compilation process is the process by which a compiler translates source code written in a programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer.  The process typically involves several stages:Lexical Analysis: The compiler reads the source code and identifies the tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc. ) in the code. Syntax Analysis: The compiler analyzes the structure of the code to ensure that it conforms to the syntax rules of the programming language.  This stage involves creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the code. Semantic Analysis: The compiler performs checks to ensure that the code is semantically correct, such as checking that variables are declared before they are used, and that functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments. Code Generation: The compiler generates machine code that can be executed by the computer.  This involves translating the AST into a lower-level representation of the code, such as assembly language or machine code. Optimization: The compiler may perform various optimizations on the generated code to improve its performance or reduce its size.  This may involve removing redundant code, reordering instructions, or replacing code with more efficient alternatives. Once the compilation process is complete, the resulting machine code can be executed by the computer's processor.  The process of compilation is typically performed by a dedicated software program called a compiler, which is specific to the programming language being used. ",1

"Newsgroups emerged in the early days of the Internet as a way for people to communicate and share information. The development of newsgroups can be traced back to the 1970s, when the first email systems were created. At the time, email was primarily used by academics and researchers to share information and collaborate on projects. By the late 1970s, a new communications protocol called Usenet was developed that allowed people to post and read messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups. Usenet is decentralized, meaning anyone with an Internet connection can participate in discussions and post messages in newsgroups on a variety of topics. As the Internet became more popular in the 1990s, the number of people using newsgroups also increased. At its peak, there were thousands of newsgroups covering a wide range of topics including politics, religion, sports, and entertainment. Some newsgroups are moderated by volunteers to ensure discussions remain civil and relevant, while others are unmoderated and often become heated and contentious. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of newsgroups began to decline with the emergence of social media and other online forms of communication such as instant messaging. However, newsgroups still exist today, albeit with a much smaller user base than in their heyday.",1
"Internet journalism, also known as Usenet, is a distributed online discussion system that allows users to read and post messages in public discussion forums, known as newsgroups. Each newsgroup is dedicated to a specific topic and users can browse, search, and participate in discussions related to that topic. Following are the main characteristics and structure of online news and newsgroups: Hierarchy: Newsgroups are organized into a hierarchy, starting from major categories such as ""comp"" (computer-related discussions), ""sci"" (science-related discussions), ""soc"" (social discussion) and ""rec"" (recreational discussion) begin. Each major category is further broken down into more specific subcategories. Message publishing: Users can publish messages to newsgroups by composing messages in news reading software and submitting them to the news server. The message is then distributed to all servers that subscribe to the newsgroup. News threads: Online news uses a thread system to organize related messages together in a tree structure. Users can easily follow conversations by viewing messages in the order they were posted and understanding how they are related. Subscriptions: Users can subscribe to newsgroups that interest them, and their news reading software will automatically download all new messages in these newsgroups. Moderators: Some newsgroups are run by volunteer moderators, who review messages before they are posted to ensure they are relevant and appropriate to the newsgroup topic. Moderators can also delete messages that violate group rules. Archives: Online news messages are archived on news servers, and users can search the archives to find old news or topics of interest. Distribution: Web news messages are distributed across a network of news servers that synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users. In summary, online news and newsgroups provide a decentralized, distributed system for online discussion and information sharing, with hierarchies, message threads, subscriptions, and archives.

"Netnews, also known as Usenet, operates as a distributed network for sharing news and insights through messages posted to various newsgroups. This system is non-centralized, implying there's no single server or authority overseeing it. Instead, message dissemination occurs over a network of interlinked servers, synchronizing to ensure all messages reach every user. Here's an overview of how netnews functions: Posting: Users draft and send messages to a newsgroup using their newsreader software, which then forwards these to the local news server. These messages are propagated across other subscribing servers throughout the network. Replication and Synchronization: Every news server holds a copy of the messages it receives and periodically syncs with other servers for new messages and updates. This uniformity guarantees that users can access the latest discussions from any server in the network. Reading: Users explore and read messages in newsgroups through their newsreader software, which fetches messages from their local news server and, if necessary, from other servers in the network. Threading: Netnews organizes messages in a tree-like structure based on their subject and message ID, facilitating easy tracking of conversations and the evolution of discussions. Archiving: Messages are typically stored on news servers, allowing users to retrieve past discussions even after they're removed from their original posting server. In essence, the distribution and consumption of netnews hinge on a decentralized, peer-to-peer system, reliant on the coordinated syncing and duplication of messages across a server network. This system provides users with broad access to diverse topics and discussions, while also ensuring message redundancy to avoid loss or data corruption.",1

"The hexadecimal system is like a cool, computer-friendly way of counting that uses a base of 16. It's a big deal in computing and digital stuff because it's super efficient for handling binary data. In hex, each digit can be one of 16 values, ranging from 0 to 9 and A to F. The first 10 are just like normal numbers, but then we throw in the letters A to F for 10 to 15. For instance, in hex, the number 10 is just the letter A, and 15 is the letter F. Converting hex to regular decimal numbers involves some math – you multiply each hex digit by its corresponding power of 16 and then add them up. Take the hex number 3B, for example: 3B = (3 x 16^1) + (11 x 16^0)= (3 x 16) + (11 x 1)= 48 + 11= 59. Now, turning a regular decimal number into hex involves a bit of division and some remainder magic. You divide the number by 16, note the remainder, and keep going until the quotient becomes zero. Then, you write down those remainders in reverse order, and voila, you've got your hex number. Let's say we want to turn 210 into hex: 210 \div 16 &= 13 \text{ with a remainder of } 2 \\ 13 \div 16 &= 0 \text{ with a remainder of } 13 \text{ (which is represented by the letter D)}. \end{align*} \] So, 210 in hex is D2. Hex is like the secret code language for computers, and it's kinda fun once you get the hang of it!",1
"In the world of computer science, think of a heap as a fancy way to organize a bunch of elements, like numbers or data, in a tree-like structure. There are two main types: Max heap, where the big shots (parent nodes) are always greater than or equal to their underlings (child nodes), and the big boss is the root node—the biggest element. On the flip side, there's Min heap, where the leaders (parent nodes) are always smaller than or equal to their followers (child nodes), and the top dog is the root node—the smallest element. Why do we bother with heaps? Well, they're handy in all sorts of computer tricks, like sorting stuff, dealing with graphs, and making priority queues. Now, the most common magic trick we do with heaps is inserting a new element. We add it in a way that keeps everything in order, with the big cheeses at the top for a max heap or the small fries for a min heap. But wait, there's more! We also do this thing called deletion. We yank out the big cheese from the top (root node) and swap in someone else, all while keeping the order intact. It's like rearranging the VIP section. Heap operations don't stop there. We can search for a specific element, blend two heaps together, or grab the biggest (or smallest) element without causing chaos. The cool part? These heap operations are pretty fast, with an average time complexity of O(log n) for both adding and removing elements. So, whenever you need a quick and efficient way to handle a bunch of items, heaps are the go-to choice in the world of algorithms.",1

"The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is like the brain of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Its main job is to handle basic math and logical tasks, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and dealing with logical operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and more. Think of it as a really smart calculator inside your computer. The ALU takes information from the CPU's internal storage and memory, does the requested calculation, and then puts the result back in storage or memory. Basically, it's the go-to guy for all the number crunching and decision-making in your computer. What the ALU does is decided by instructions given to the CPU by the computer's software. So, if you're running a program or playing a game, the ALU is the one doing the heavy lifting to make things happen. The ALU's performance is super important for how well your computer works because it handles most of the tasks the CPU performs. How fast and efficient it is can make a big difference in your computer's overall speed. In today's computers, the ALU is part of the CPU's digital circuitry.

"So, in the world of computer programming, think of a class like a handy template or blueprint. It's like a master plan for creating objects, which are these neat, self-contained bits of code that do specific things. Now, this blueprint, or class, isn't just a boring document. It's where you define what your objects can do and what they're made of. Imagine objects as characters in a video game, and the class is the script that gives them their unique abilities and characteristics. In this script (or class), you've got your data members, which are like the traits or features of your objects. These could be things like color, size, or any other details that describe your object's state. Then, you've got methods, which are like the actions your object can take. Maybe your object is a superhero, and the methods define how they can fly, fight, or save the day. But wait, there's more! Classes can also have constructors, which are like the initiation ceremonies for objects. They're special methods that bring your objects to life and give them their initial settings. And when your objects have had their time in the spotlight and it's time to clean up, there are destructors. These are like the janitors of the programming world, making sure everything gets tidied up when an object is no longer needed. Oh, and classes can be related to each other, too. It's like having a family tree where one class inherits stuff from another. So, you can have a general class, like a 'LivingBeing,' and then create more specific classes, like 'Human' or 'Cat,' that inherit all the cool things from the general one. In a nutshell, a class is like the ultimate organizer in the programming universe. It helps you create objects with their own personalities, actions, and relationships, making your code more reusable and flexible. It's basically the foundation of this cool programming style called object-oriented programming!",1
"The Access Control Matrix (ACM) is like a security bouncer for your computer. It's a fancy table that shows who can do what with the stuff on your computer. Imagine it as a guest list where each person (or program) has their own row, and each party item (file, folder, gadget) has its own column. The table tells you what each person is allowed to do with each party item – like read, write, dance, or delete. So, in this matrix, if a cell says ""rwx,"" it means that person can read, write, and execute (party hard) with that party item. The ACM is basically a way to make sure only the cool, authorized folks get access to specific things on your computer. Besides being a bouncer, the ACM is also like a detective. It helps keep track of who's been where and done what on your computer. This is handy because you can always look at the matrix and know exactly who's got the green light for certain party items. There are different styles of using this bouncer matrix, like the ""Decide Whatever You Want"" model, the ""Bossy"" model, and the ""Role Playing"" model. They each have their own way of deciding who gets access based on who they are or what they're up to at the party.",1
"Active OS fingerprinting is like a detective move used to figure out what operating system is running on a remote system or device. Basically, it sends special network messages and looks at how the system responds. This is often done by cybersecurity folks or network pros to spot systems that might be easy targets for attacks. Bad actors might also use this trick to find systems they can exploit. It works by sending specific messages to the target system and then checking out how the system reacts. These messages might have certain flags or options that make the operating system respond in specific ways. By comparing these responses to a database of known operating systems, you can tell what system is running. It's a bit intrusive since it actively probes the target system, and it might set off security alarms, but it's usually more accurate than just watching network traffic.",1
"Active Server Pages (ASP) is like a web page magician used to create dynamic web pages and applications. Microsoft cooked it up in the late '90s for making cool web stuff on Windows servers. ASP scripts, written in languages like VBScript or JScript, are like secret ingredients embedded in HTML pages. When someone asks for an ASP page, the web server runs the script and cooks up dynamic HTML pages to send back to the user. ASP can do a bunch of things like talk to databases, handle forms, manage sessions, and check who's who. It can also team up with other web tech like CSS, JavaScript, and XML. There's a fancier version called ASP.NET that's more modern, modular, scalable, and secure.

"The compilation process involves several stages, transforming programming language code into executable machine code. It starts with lexical analysis, identifying code tokens, followed by syntax analysis to check language rules. Semantic analysis ensures logical correctness, leading to machine code generation. The compiler optimizes this code for performance and size. Each stage, from interpreting tokens to generating efficient machine code, is critical in creating functional, optimized software.",1
"NLP is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguistics and computer science, particularly artificial intelligence ,.  In terms of linguistics, a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple meanings (“wind up the clock” and “the wind is cold today”) as well as grammatical ambiguities (in the phrase “little girl’s school” is it the school that is little, the girls, or both?).  Of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity. Programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems, including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a “corpus” of existing text in that language ,. As formidable as the task of extracting the correct (literal) meaning from text can be, it is really only the first level of natural language processing.  If a program is to successfully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from North Korea, for example, it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and/or a set of “frames” , about how to interpret various situations such as threat, bluff, or compromise. )",0

"As each new means of communication and social interaction is introduced, social customs and etiquette evolve in response.  For example, it took time before the practice of saying “hello” and identifying oneself became the universal way to initiate a phone conversation. By the 1980s, a system of topical news postings , carried on the Internet was becoming widely used in universities, the computer industry, and scientific institutions.  Many new users did not understand the system, and posted messages that were off topic.  Others used their postings as to insult or attack (“flame”) other users, particularly in newsgroups discussing perennially controversial topics such as abortion.  When a significant number of postings in a newsgroup are devoted to flaming and counter-flaming, many users who had sought civilized, intelligent discussion leave in protest. In 1984, Chuq von Rospach wrote a document entitled “A Primer on How to Work with the Usenet Community. ” It and later guides to net etiquette or “netiquette” offered useful guidelines to new users and to more experienced users who wanted to facilitate civil discourse. ",0
"These suggestions include:, Learn about the purpose of a newsgroup before you post to it.  If a group is moderated, understand the moderator’s guidelines so your postings won’t be rejected. , Before posting, follow some discussions to see what sort of language, tone, and attitude seems to be appropriate for this group Do not post bulky graphics or other attachments unless the group is designed for them. , Avoid “ad hominem” (to the person) attacks when discussing disagreements. , Do not post in ALL CAPS, which is interpreted as “shouting. ”, Check your postings for proper spelling and grammar.  On the other hand, avoid “flaming” other users for their spelling or grammar errors. , When replying to an existing message, include enough of the original message to provide context for your reply, but no more. , If you know the answer to a question or problem raised by another user, send it to that user by e-mail.  That way the newsgroup doesn’t get cluttered up with dozens of versions of the same information. ",0
"In recent years there has been growing concern that Internet users may eventually be treated differently by service providers depending on the kind of data they download or the kind of application programs they use online.  Advocates of network (or net) neutrality , want legislation that would bar cable, DSL, or other providers , from making such distinctions, such as by charging content providers higher fees for high volumes of data or even blocking certain applications.  Advocates of net neutrality believe that, since there are rather limited choices for broadband Internet service, discrimination on the basis of Web content could lead to a loss of freedom for consumers and providers alike",0
"By the late 1970s, researchers at many major universities were using the UNIX operating system ,.  In 1979, a suite of utilities called UUCP was distributed with the widely used UNIX Version 7.  These utilities could be used to transfer files between UNIX computers that were linked by some form of telephone or network connection. Two Duke University graduate students, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, decided to set up a way in which users on different computers could share a collection of files containing text messages on various topics.  They wrote a simple set of shell scripts that could be used for distributing and viewing these message files.  The first version of the news network linked computers at Duke and at the University of North Carolina.  Soon these programs were revised and rewritten in the C language and distributed to other UNIX users as the “A” release of the News software. During the 1980s, the news system was expanded and features such as moderated newsgroups were added.  As the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol , became a more widespread standard for connecting computers, a version of News using the NNTP (Network News Transmission Protocol) over the Internet was released in 1986.  Netnews is a mature system today, with news reading software available for virtually every type of computer",0
"Netnews postings are simply text files that begin with a set of standard headers, similar to those used in e-mail.  (Like e-mail, news postings can have binary graphics or program files attached, using a standard called MIME, for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. )The files are stored on news servers—machines that have the spare capacity to handle the hundreds of gigabytes of messages now posted each week.  The files are stored in a typical hierarchical UNIX fashion, grouped into approximately 75,000 different newsgroups. As shown in the following table, the newsgroups are broken down into 10 major categories.  The names of individual groups begin with the major category and then specify subdivisions.  For example, the newsgroup comp. sys. ibm. pc deals with IBM PC-compatible personal computers, while comp. os. linux deals with the Linux operating system. ",0
"The servers are linked into a branching distribution system.  Messages being posted by users are forwarded to the nearest major regional “node” site, which in turn distributes them to other major nodes.  In turn, when messages arrive at a major node from another region, they are distributed to all the smaller sites that share the newsfeed.  Due to the volume of groups and messages, many sites now choose to receive only a subset of the total newsfeed.  Sites also determine when messages will expire (and thus be removed from the site). There are dozens of different news reading programs that can be used to view the available newsgroups and postings.  On UNIX systems, programs such as elm and tin are popular, while other newsreaders cater to Windows, Macintosh, and other systems.  Major Web browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer offer simplified news reading features.  To use these news readers, the user accesses a newsfeed at an address provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).  There are also services that let users simply navigate through the news system by following the links on a Web page.  The former service called DejaNews, now Google Groups, is the best-known and most complete such site",0
"In the 1940s, the main objective in developing the first digital computers was to speed up the process of calculation.  In the 1950s, the machines began to be used for more general data-processing tasks by governments and business.  By the 1960s, computers were in use in most major academic, government, and business organizations.  The desire for users to share data and to communicate both within and outside their organization led to efforts to link computers together into networks. Computer manufacturers began to develop proprietary networking software to link their computers, but they were limited to a particular kind of computer, such as a DEC PDP minicomputer, or an IBM mainframe.  However, the U. S.  Defense Department, seeing the need for a robust, decentralized network that could maintain links between their computers under wartime conditions, funded the development of a protocol that, given appropriate hardware to bridge the gap, could link these disparate networks ,.

"According to the OSI (open systems interconnection) model, a network can be considered to be a series of seven layers laid one atop another ,. The physical layer is at the bottom.  It specifies the physical connections between the computers, which can be anything from ordinary phone lines to cable, fiber optic, or wireless.  This layer specifies the required electrical characteristics (such as voltage changes and durations that constitute the physical signal that is recognized as either a 1 or 0 in the “bit stream. ”The next layer, called the data link layer, specifies how data will be grouped into chunks of bits (frames or packets) and how transmission errors will be dealt with ,. The network layer groups the data frames as parts of a properly formed data packet and routes that packet from the sending node to the specified destination node.  A variety of routing algorithms can be used to determine the most efficient route given current traffic or line conditions. The transport layer views the packets as part of a complete transmission of an object (such as a Web page) and ensures that all the packets belonging to that object are sorted into their original sequence at the destination.  This is necessary because packets belonging to the same message may be sent via different routes in keeping with traffic or line conditions. The session layer provides application programs communicating over the network with the ability to initiate, terminate, or restart an interrupted data transfer. The presentation layer ensures that data formats are consistent so that all applications know what to expect.  This layer can also provide special services ,. Finally, the application layer gives applications highlevel commands for performing tasks over the network, such as file transfer protocol (ftp)",0
"A network attached storage (NAS) unit can be thought of as a dedicated data storage unit that is available to all users of a network.  Unlike a traditional dedicated file storage unit ,, a NAS unit typically has an operating system and software designed specifically (and only) for providing data storage services.  The actual storage is usually provided by an array of hard drives ,.  Files on the NAS are accessed through protocols such as SMB (server message block), common on Windows networks, and NFS (network file system), used on many UNIX and some Linux networks.  In recent years smaller, lower-cost NAS devices have become available for smaller networks, including home networks, where they can store music, video, and other files ,",0
"Although it sounds similar, a storage area network (SAN) does not function as its own file server.  Rather, it attaches storage modules such as hard drives or tape libraries to an existing server so that it appears to the server’s operating system as though it were locally attached.  Typically the protocol used to attach the storage is SCSI ,, but the physical connection is fiber or high-speed Ethernet.  The emphasis for SAN applications is the need for fast access to data, such as in large online databases, e-mail servers, and high-volume file servers.  SANs offer great flexibility, since storage can be expanded without changing the network structure, and a replacement server can quickly be attached to the storage in case of hardware failure",0
"In the kind of science fiction sometimes called “cyberpunk,”people are able to “jack in” or connect their brains directly tocomputer networks.  Because of this direct input into the brain(or perhaps the optic and other sensory nerves), a personwho is jacked in experiences the virtual world as fully real,and can (depending on the world’s rules) manipulate it withhis or her mind.  This kind of all-immersive virtual reality isstill science fiction, but today people are beginning to controlcomputers and artificial limbs directly with their minds. ",0
"Neuroprosthetics is the creation of artificial limbs or sensoryorgans that are directly connected to the nervous system. The first (and most widely used) example is the cochlearimplant, which can restore hearing by taking sound signals from a microphone and converting them to electricalimpulses that directly stimulate auditory nerves within thecochlea, a part of the inner ear.  Similarly, experimental retinal implants that stimulate optic nerves are beginning tooffer crude but useful vision to certain blind patients. Research in connecting the brain to artificial arms orlegs is still in its early stages, but scientists using microelectrode arrays have been able to record signals from thebrain’s neurons and correlate them to different types ofmotor movements.  In a series of experiments at Duke University, researchers first trained a monkey to operate a joystick to move a shape in a video game.  They then recordedand analyzed the signals produced by the monkey’s brainwhile playing the game, and correlated them with themotor movements in the joystick.  Next, they replicatedthese movements with a robotic arm as the monkey movedthe joystick.  Finally, they were able to train the monkey tomove the robotic arm without using the joystick at all, simply by “thinking” about the movements. ",0
"As more is learned about the detailed functioning of neuronal networks inside the brain, “cognitive prosthetics” maybecome feasible.  One example might be computer memory modules that might act as a surrogate or extension ofhuman memory, perhaps helping compensate for loss ofmemory due to age or disease.  (Early experiments on interfacing to the hippocampus, a part of the brain important forforming memories, have been underway since 2003. )Other possibilities might include processors that couldgive a person the ability to think about a mathematicalproblem and “see” the answer, or to search databases or theWeb simply by visualizing or thinking about the information desired",0
"Integers (whole numbers) have the simplest representation, but there are two important considerations: the totalnumber of bits available and whether one bit is used to holdthe sign. Since all numbers are stored as binary digits, an unsignedinteger has a range from 0 to 2bits where “bits” is the totalnumber of bits available.  Thus if there are 16 bits available, the maximum value for an integer is 65535.  If negativenumbers are to be handled, a signed integer must be used(in most languages such as C, C++, and Java, an integer issigned unless unsigned is specified).  Since one bit is usedto hold the sign and each bit doubles the maximum size, itfollows that a signed integer can have only half the rangeabove or below zero.  Thus, a 16-bit signed integer can rangefrom -32,768 to 32,767. One complication is that the available sizes of integersdepend on whether the computer system’s native data sizeis 16, 32, or 64 bits.  In most cases the native size is 32 bits,so the declaration “int” in a C program on such a machineimplies a signed 32-bit integer that can range from - 231 or-2,147,483,647 to 231-1, or 2,147,483,647.  However, if one isusing large numbers in a program, it is important to checkthat the chosen type is large enough.  The long specifier isoften used to indicate an integer twice the normal size, or64 bits in this case. ",0
"Numbers with a fractional (decimal) part are usually storedin a format called floating point.  The “floating” means thatthe location of the decimal point can be moved as necessaryto fit the number within the specified digit range.  A floatingpoint number is actually stored in four separate parts.  Firstcomes the sign, indicating whether the number is negativeor positive.  Next comes the mantissa, which contains theactual digits of the number, both before and after the decimal point.  The radix is the “base” for the number systemused.  Finally, the exponent determines where the decimalpoint will be placed. For example, the base 10 number 247. 35 could be represented as 24735 × 10-2.  The -2 moves the decimal pointat the end two places to the left.  However, floating-pointnumbers are normalized to a form in which there is just onedigit to the left of the decimal point.  Thus, 247. 35 wouldactually be written 2. 4735 × 102.  This system is also knownas scientific notation. As noted earlier, actual data storage in modern computers is always in binary, but the same principle applies. According to IEEE Standard 754, 32-bit floating-point numbers use 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23bits for the mantissa (also called the significand, since itexpressed the digits that are significant—that is, guaranteed not to be “lost” through overflow or underflow in processing).  The double precision float, declared as a “double”in C programs, uses 1, 11, and 52 bits respectively. ",0
"Many objects are more elaborate or specialized variations ofmore basic objects.  For example, in Microsoft Windows thevarious kinds of dialog boxes are specialized versions of thegeneral Window class.  Therefore, the specialized versionis created by declaring it to be derived from a “base class. ”Put another way, the specialized class inherits the basicdata and functions available in the base (parent) class.  Theprogrammer can then add new data or functions or modifythe inherited ones to create the necessary behavior for thespecialized class. Languages such as C++ allow for a class to be derivedfrom more than one base class.  This is called multipleinheritance.  For example, a Message Window class mightinherit its overall structure from the Window class andits text-display capabilities from the Message class.  However, it can sometimes be difficult to keep the relationshipsbetween multiple classes clear.  The Java language takes thealternative approach of being limited to only single inheritance of classes, but allowing interfaces (specifications ofhow a class interacts with the program) to be multiplyinherited. ",0
"Different kinds of objects often have analogous methods. For example, suppose there is a series of classes that represent various polygons: square, triangle, hexagon, and so forth.  Each class has a method called “perimeter” thatreturns the total distance around the edges of the object.  Ifeach of these classes is derived from a base polygon class,each class inherits the base class’s perimeter method andadapts it for its own use.  Thus, a square might calculateits perimeter simply by multiplying the length of a side byfour, while the rectangle would have to add up differentsized pairs of sides, and so on. ",0
"In the late 1990s “banner ads” started to appear on Websites, and other forms of advertising soon followed.  Companies rushed into the online world, either with the belief thatit had unlimited potential for finding new customers, or outof fear that the competition would get there first.  Unfortunately it was hard to measure the actual effectiveness ofads, and Web sites (such as for publications) that lookedto third-party advertising as a source of income found theoutlook bleak in the wake of the bursting of the “dot-combubble” of the early 2000 decade. Only a few years later, however, advertisers using newbusiness models and targeting techniques have made onlineadvertising not only a viable business, but a rapidly growing one.  (According to the Interactive Advertsing Bureau,Internet advertising revenue in the United States in 2007was $21. 2 billion, up 26 percent from 2005. )The effects of the online advertising revolution are rippling outward, impacting traditional advertising mediasuch as newspapers (in particular see craigslist), magazines, and even television.

"Google and other large search enginesor portals can make money from advertisers is through“affiliate marketing”; Google’s version is called Ad Sense. Participating Web sites are indexed, and the resulting keywords are matched with ads awaiting placement.  The sitecarrying the ad generally gets a per-click payment.  However, the problem of “click fraud” has also arisen: Scammerscan set up an affiliate site and then use special software togenerate the clicks, while making them come from a varietyof sources.  Despite these problems, in 2006 about 40 percent of revenue from online advertising was attributed tosearch-related ads. ",0
"The dark side of online advertising is found in programsthat are surreptitiously installed on users’ PCs and thendownload and display advertising from shady Web operations ,.  While many users nowregularly run programs to block such malware, even legitimate online advertising can irritate users, particularlywhen ads are too prominent, float over (and block) text, orlurk behind the browser window.  Modern Web browsershave ad-blocking features that work with varying degreesof effectiveness.  As with TV, online advertisers increasinglyhave to cope with impatient users who do not have to lookat ads unless they actually want to. Advertisers can employ several strategies to keep userswilling to look at ads.  One is to make the ad unobtrusiveand brief, and on the way to something the user reallywants to see.  In 2007 YouTube began such advertising. Another is to provide free versions of software or servicesthat, in exchange for being free, require the user to put upwith some screen real estate being devoted to ads.  Finally,as with TV, advertising can be woven into the content itself,such as in online computer games. A sensitive area is the attempt to balance advertisers’desire to know as much as possible about consumers’ interestsand buying habits with the same consumers’ concern aboutprotecting their privacy",0

"Online casinos appeared in 1995, but at first they couldonly be played “for fun,” with no actual money changinghands.  That soon changed: In 1996, InterCasino appeared—it would be the first of hundreds of online casinos, sportsbookmakers, and other types of gambling.  Generally theseoperations are based outside of the United States—Caribbean islands such as Antigua and Curaçao are popular locations. Online casinos offer traditional table games such asblackjack, roulette, and craps.  Generally odds and payoffsare comparable to those at traditional casinos.  Assumingthe game is honest and properly programmed, the house’srevenue comes from a percentage of the amount bet—blackjack having the lowest house percentage and roulette thegreatest.  Slot machines (which give an even higher percentage to the house) can also be simulated online. ",0
"Online poker has become very popular, particularly gamessuch as Texas Hold’Em.  Estimated revenues from onlinepoker in the United States were $2. 4 billion in 2005. Unlike the case with casino games, online poker playersplay against each other, not the house.  The house’s revenuecomes from a “rake,” or percentage, of the pot.  Many sitesoffer organized tournaments, and some online players havegone on to win traditional tournaments.  (The aptly namedChris Moneymaker won an online tournament, qualifyinghim to enter the 2004 World Series of Poker, which he wenton to win. )Like online casinos, online poker is illegal in the UnitedStates.  Proponents argue that while any given hand is random, poker in the long run is a game of skill, not chance.  Agroup called the Poker Players Alliance has been lobbyingto exempt poker from Internet gambling laws. A third type of online gambling is sports betting, whichis legal in many countries but only in Nevada in the UnitedStates.  The Web has also given sports bettors a forum fordiscussing (or arguing about) teams and their prospects. ",0
"Online games today range from elaborate war games toopen-ended fantasy worlds to virtual universes that mirror“real-world” activities, including economics, politics, andeven education. The first online games appeared in the late 1970s onPLATO, an educational network, as well as on the earlyInternet of the 1980s.  These MUDs (multiuser dungeons)were generally based on pen-and-paper role-playing gamesof the time, notably Dungeons & Dragons.  These games were text based, with players typing their characters’ actionsand dialog while the changing world as seen by the players was similarly described.  By the early 1990s, however,MUDs had spun off many variants.  Many were still “hackn’ slash” dungeon games (which were also offered on America Online and other commercial services).  Many of theseMUD-like games such as AOL’s Neverwinter Nights offeredsimple graphics.  Meanwhile other games began to offermore sophisticated social interactions as well as the abilityof players to make their own additions to the game world,including buildings. ",0
"Today’s online games feature a “persistent world” hosted onone or more servers that grows and develops from day to dayand in which the “avatars” or representatives of thousandsof players interact with game-generated creatures or oneanother, using client software.  Players can spend hundredsof hours helping their characters develop skills, increasingtheir levels through experience points gained from successful combat or other activities.  Players (and their characters) frequently form organizations such as guilds or clans,because the tougher challenges generally require the cooperation of different types of classes of characters (fighters,healers, and magic-users). Modern MM ORPGs began in the late 1990s with suchtitles as Ultima Online and EverQuest.  The most popularMMORPG in the mid-2000s was World of Warcraft. ",0
"As with shoppers, investors have increasingly been attractedto the interactivity and ease of online transactions.  In addition to allowing stocks to be bought or sold with just a fewclicks, online brokers (also called discount brokers) chargemuch lower transaction fees than their traditional counterparts, typically less than $10 per trade. Some online brokers, such as E*Trade, Scottrade, andTD Ameritrade, were established as Internet brokers.  However, traditional brokerages such as Charles Schwab andWaterhouse have also opened online discount brokerages. In addition to fast, inexpensive trading, many onlinebrokers also offer a variety of resources and tools, including stock quotes and charts, research reports, and screening programs to help investors pick the mutual funds orindividual investments that meet their objectives.  For moresophisticated investors, some brokers offer simulations fortesting investment strategies and programmed trading,which will execute buy or sell orders automatically depending on specified conditions. Online brokers can specialize, seeking customers whowant to make frequent trades but do not need other support, or investors who are interested in obtaining IPOs (initial public offerings) of up-and-coming companies.  Somebrokers may emphasize mutual funds and cater to retirement accounts, while others might offer government or corporate bonds, foreign stocks, “penny stocks,” or more exoticinvestments. The interactivity and low transaction costs in onlineinvesting may encourage people to become involved inhighly speculative penny stocks, options, day trading, foreign exchange markets, and other areas that are not suitablefor most individual investors.  While there is a great dealof useful information available online, it is a good idea tobegin by discussing investment goals and potential riskswith a trusted financial adviser. ",0

"A persistent problem in artificial intelligence , is how to provide a software systemwith a model that it can use to reason about a particularsubject or domain.  A data model or ontology basically consists of classes to which the relevant objects might belong,relationships between classes, and attributes that objects inthat class can possess.  (For implementation of these ideaswithin programming languages, see classes and objectoriented programming. )For example, a business ontology might include classessuch as:, Entity—a business or person, Supplier—an Entity that provides wholesale goods orservices, Customer—an Entity that buys the company’s goodsor services, Contractor—an Entity that performs work for thecompany on contract",0
"Ontologies can be used to provide guidance to a variety oftypes of programs (for example, see expert system, natural language processing, and software agent).  Thusif an automatic news summarizer program encounters astory that includes references to opposing lawyers and legalissues, it could apply an ontology that defines the likelyrelationship of the participants in the case. Creating useful ontologies is quite labor intensive interms of the human thinking and coding involved.  However, there have been substantial efforts in recent years tocreate anthologies for many fields, particularly in biologyand genetics.  The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is apopular tool for creating ontologies that can be used tomake Web content more understandable to programs ,. Meanwhile, an ambitious and long-running projectcalled Cyc (for Encyclopedia) under the direction of Douglas Lenat has been engaged in creating what amounts tovast ontologies for many of the domains included in everyday human life as well as specialized fields of knowledge.  Alarge portion of this work has been made available as opensource. ",0
"According to Stallman and many other advocates, “opensource” software is not necessarily free.  What is requiredis that users receive the full source code (or have it readilyavailable for free or at nominal charge).  Users are free tomodify or expand the source code to create and distributenew versions of the software.  Following a legal mechanismthat Stallman calls “copyleft,” the distributor of opensource software must allow subsequent recipients the samefreedom to revise and redistribute.  However, not all software that is billed as open source follows all of Stallman’srequirements, including being copylefted.  Formally, opensource software is generally licensed according to variousversions of the General Public License (GPL).  The latestversion, GPL3, released in 2007, has been controversial. Among other things, it more aggressively attempts to prevent open-source software from being restricted or otherwise hampered by being combined with patented softwareor proprietary hardware. ",0
"An operating system is an overarching program that manages the resources of the computer.  It runs programs andprovides them with access to memory (RAM), input/outputdevices, a file system, and other services.  It provides application programmers with a way to invoke system services, andgives users a way to control programs and organize files. The “core” functions include “booting” the system and initializing devices, process management(loading programs intro memory assigning them a share ofprocessing time), and allowing processes to communicatewith the operating system or one another ,. Multiprogramming systems often implement not only processes (running programs) but also threads, or sections ofcode within programs that can be controlled separately. A memory management scheme is used to organize andaddress memory, handle requests to allocate memory, freeup memory no longer being used, and rearrange memory tomaximize the useful amount ,. There is also a scheme for organizing data created orused by programs into files of various types ,.  Mostoperating systems today have a hierarchical file system thatallows for files to be organized into directories or foldersthat can be further subdivided if necessary",0
"Designers of modern operating systems face a numberof continuing challenges:, security, in a world where nearly all computers arenetworked, often continuously ,, the tradeoff between powerful, attractive functionssuch as scripting and the security vulnerabilities theytend to present, the need to provide support for new applications suchas streaming audio and video ,, ease of use in installing new devices ,The continuing development of new user-interfaceconcepts, including alternative interfaces for the disabled and for special applications ,, the growing use of multiprocessing and multiprogramming, requiring coordination of processors sharingmemory and communicating with one another ,, distributed systems where server programs, clientprograms, and data objects can be allocated amongmany networked computers, and allocations continually adjusted or balanced to reflect demand on thesystem ,, the spread of portable, mobile, and handheld computers and computers embedded in devices such asengine control systems ,.

"Today it is easy to optically scan text or graphics printed onpages and convert it into a graphical representation for storage in the computer ,.  However, a shape suchas a letter c doesn’t mean anything in particular as a graphic. Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of identifying the letter or other document element that correspondsto a given part of the scanned image and converting it tothe appropriate character ,.  Ifthe process is successful, the result is a text document thatcan be manipulated in a word processor, database, or otherprogram that handles text.  Raymond Kurzweil (1948– )marketed the first commercially practicable general-purposeoptical character recognition system in 1978. ",0
"Once the document page has been scanned into an imageformat, there are various ways to identify the characters. One method is to use stored templates that indicate the pattern of pixels that should correspond to each character.  Generally, a threshold of similarity is defined so that an exactmatch is not necessary to classify a character: The templatemost similar to the character is chosen.  Some systems storea set of templates for each of the fonts most commonly foundin printed text.  (Recognizing cursive writing is a much morecomplex process: See handwriting recognition. )A more generalized method uses structural features(such as “all t’s have a single vertical line and a shortercrossbar line”) to classify characters.  To analyze a character,the different types of individual features are identified andthen compared to a set of rules to determine the charactercorresponding to that particular combination of features. Sometimes thresholds or “fuzzy logic” are used to decidethe probable identity of a character. ",0
"Jaguar, panther, tiger, and leopard—these and other namesof sleek big cats represent versions of Apple’s Macintoshoperating system, OS X (pronounced “OS 10”—see AppleCorporation and Macintosh).  Unlike the previous MacOS, OS X, while broadly maintaining Apple’s user interfacestyle ,, is based on a version of UNIXcalled OpenStep, developed by NeXT starting in the 1980s,.  OS X development began when Steve Jobsreturned as Apple CEO in 1997 ,and the company bought NeXT, acquiring the software.  Thefirst version, OS X 10. 0, or Cheetah, was released in 2001,but the system was not widely used until 10. 1 (Puma) wasreleased later the same year. At the core of OS X is a free and open-source version ofUNIX called “Darwin,” with a kernel called XNU.  On top ofthis Apple built a distinctive and subtly colorful user interface called Aqua and a new version of the Macintosh Finderfile and program management system",0
"Today OS X includes a variety of useful software packages—some free and some optional.  These include iLife (digitalmedia management), iWork (productivity), and Front Row(home media center).  OS X10. 5 also includes Time Machine,an automatic backup system that can restore files (includingdeleted files) as well as earlier system settings. For software developers, OS X provides an integrateddevelopment environment called “Xcode,” which workswith modified open-source compilers for major programming languages, including C, C++, and Java.  Further,because OS X is UNIX-based, many UNIX and Linux programs can be recompiled to run on it.  Since mid-2005 Apple(and OS X) have been transitioning from the earlier IBM/Motorola processors to Intel processors.  This transition waslargely complete by 2007, though OS X 10. 5 (Leopard) stillprovides support for applications written for the PowerPC. OS X has been well received by critics, and together withits bundled software has made the Macintosh a popularplatform for users who want a seamless computing experience, particularly with regard to graphics and media.

" With a parallel connection, however, the eight bitsof the byte are sent simultaneously, each along its own wire,so parallel ports are generally faster than serial ports.  Also,since the data is transmitted simultaneously, the protocolfor marking the beginning and end of each data byte is simpler.  On the other hand, parallel cables are more expensive(since they contain more wires) and are generally limitedto a length of 10 feet or so because of electrical interferencebetween the parallel wires. The original parallel interface for personal computerswas designed by Centronics, and a later version of this 36-pin connector remains popular today.  Later, IBM designed a25-pin version.  In addition to the wires carrying data, additional wires are used to carry control signals",0
"After many years of effort researchers have been able tocreate systems that can recognize particular human faces,.  On the other hand, any normalsix-month-old child can effortlessly recognize familiarfaces (such as parents).  The fundamental task of turningraw data (whether from senses, instruments, or computerfiles) into recognizable objects or drawing inferences iscalled pattern recognition.  Pattern recognition is at theheart of many areas of research and application in computing ,. Despite the challenge in getting machines to do what comes naturally for biological organisms, the potentialpayoffs are immense. A pattern-recognition system begins with data, whetherstored or real-time (such as from a robot’s camera).  The firsttask in turning potentially billions of bytes of data intomeaningful objects is to extract features from what is likelya high proportion of redundant or irrelevant data.  (Withvisual images, this often involves finding edges that defineshapes. ) The extracted features are then classified to determine what objects they might represent.  This can be doneby comparing structures to templates or previously classified data or by applying statistical analysis to determine thelikely correlation of the new data to existing patterns ,. Pattern recognition often includes learning algorithmsas well; indeed, the field is often considered to be a subtopicof machine learning.  For example, classification systemscan be refined by “training” them and reinforcing successful determinations ,. ",0
"The first stage in making computing available away fromthe office desk was the development of “portable” and thenlaptop computers in the 1980s ,. Laptops, however, are relatively heavy and bulky, and thusnot suitable for activities such as making notes at meetings or keeping track of appointments while on the go. The logical solution to that need was to develop a computer small enough to carry in a pocket or purse.  The firsthandheld computer to achieve widespread recognition wasApple’s Newton, which the company referred to as a “personal digital assistant. ” This term, usually abbreviated toPDA, became a generic category with the introduction ofthe Palm Pilot, which first appeared in 1996, followed bythe seemingly ubiquitous RIM Blackberry in 1999.

"The PDF specifications are open source, so anyone canwrite software to create or read documents in the format. PDF includes three elements: a subset of the PostScript pagedescription language ,, a system for specifying and embedding common fonts (or referring to otherfonts), and a system for “packaging” the text and graphicsdescriptions into a file in compressed form.  Later versionsof the PDF specification also allow users to interact withthe document, such as by filling in fields in a form or adding annotations to the text.  PDF also includes support fortags , and descriptors that can be used with programs such as screen readers for the blind. PDF also includes support for encrypting documents sothey can only be read with a password, and for controllingwhether the document can be copied or printed, though thisdepends on the user’s software understanding and obeyingthe restrictions. Although creating and editing PDF documents originally required the relatively expensive Adobe Acrobat software, there are now a number of free or low-cost editorsand other PDF utilities for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/UNIX platforms.

"The explosive growth of the World Wide Web has confronted programmers with the need to find ways to link databases and other existing resources to Web sites.  The specifications for such linkages are found in the Common Gateway Interface ,.  However, the early facilities for writing CGI scripts were awkward and often frustrating to use. Back in 1986, UNIX developer Larry Wall had created a language called Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language).  There were already ways to write scripts for simple data processing , as well as a handy pattern-manipulation language ,.  However, Wall wanted to provide a greater variety of functions and techniques for finding, extracting, and formatting data.  Perl attracted a following within the UNIX community.  Since much Web development was being done on UNIX-based systems by the mid- and late-1990s, it was natural that many webmasters and applications programmers would turn to Perl to write their CGI scripts. As with many UNIX scripting languages, Perl’s syntax is broadly similar to C.  However, the philosophy behind C is to provide a sparse core language with most functionality being handled by standard or add-in program libraries.  Perl, on the other hand, starts with most of the functionality of UNIX utilities such as sed (stream editor), C shell, and awk, including the powerful regular expressions familiar to UNIX users.  The language also includes a “hash” data type (a collection of paired keys and values) that makes it easy for a program to maintain and check lists such as of Internet hosts and their IP addresses ,.

"In today’s health care environment patients often have only a few minutes to ask their doctor important questions about their condition and possible treatments.  Patients often feel they have been left on their own when it comes to obtaining detailed information.  According to surveys by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, by the end of 2005 about 20 percent of Web users were reporting that the Internet “has greatly improved the way they get information about health care. ” Further, 7 million users had reported that Web sites had “played a crucial or important role in coping with a major illness. ”A variety of Web sites ranging from comprehensive and excellent to dubious (at best) offer health-related information.  In evaluating them, it is important to determine who sponsors the site and what is the source of the information provided.  The very extensive WebMD site, for example, is reviewed for accuracy by an independent panel of experts.  One of the foremost medical institutions, the Mayo Clinic, also has an authoritative site.  The site OrganizedWisdom. com offers a search engine that emphasizes information that has been reviewed by doctors for accuracy, while eliminating low-quality or duplicative results. Even if information is accurate, however, users may often lack the necessary background or context for interpreting it correctly.  Understanding the results of medical studies, for example, requires some knowledge of how studies are designed, the population used, and the statistical significance and applicability of the results.  As a practical matter, therefore, patients should not make any major decisions about diet, medication, or treatment options without consulting a medical professional.  Attempts at self-diagnosis can be particularly prob",0
"When modern digital computing emerged in the 1940s, it evolved from two roots: engineering (particularly electrical engineering) and mathematics.  The goals of the earliest computer designers were focused naturally enough on computing, although several early thinkers , had already begun to think of computers as symbol-processing and knowledgeretrieving machines, not just number crunchers. As computer scientists began to become more concerned about the structure of data and the modeling of real-world objects in computer languages ,, they began to wrestle with some areas long familiar to philosophers.  As data structure involved into knowledge representations, epistemology (the philosophical investigation of the meaning and accessibility of knowledge) became more relevant, particularly in developing systems for artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Also relevant is ontology (the nature and relationship of entities—see ontologies and data models), particularly with regard to the modern effort to encode relationships between items of knowledge into Web pages ,",0
"Just about anyone with an e-mail account has received messages purporting to be from a bank, a popular e-commerce site such as Amazon or eBay, or even a government agency.  Typically the message warns of a problem (such as a suspended account) and urges the recipient to click on a link in the message.  If the user does so, what appears to look like the actual site of the relevant institution is actually a “spoof,” or fake site.  If the user goes on to enter information such as account numbers or passwords in order to fix the “problem,” the information actually goes to the operator of the fake site, where it can be used for fraudulent purchases or even impersonation ,.  The bogus site can also attempt to download viruses, spyware, keyloggers, or other forms of “malware” to the unwitting user’s computerThis all-too-common scenario is called “phishing,” alluding to “fishing” for unwary users with various sorts of bait, with the f changed to ph in keeping with traditional hacker practice.  Phishing is similar to other techniques for manipulating people through deception, fear, or greed that hackers often refer to as “social engineering. ” Unlike oneon-one approaches, however, phishing relies on the ability to send large quantities of e-mail at virtually no cost ,, the availability of simple techniques for disguising both e-mail addresses and Web addresses (URLs), and the ease with which the appearance of a Web site can be convincingly replicated. Although e-mail is the most common “hook” for phishing, any form of communication, including text or instant messages, can be used.  Recently sites such as MySpace have become targets for automated phishing expeditions that changed links on pages to point to fraudulent sites ",0
"Wary users have a number of ways to reduce their chance of being “phished. ” Some signs of bogus messages include:, The message is addressed generically (“dear PayPal user”) or to the user’s e-mail address rather than the account name. , The text of the message contains spelling errors or poor grammar. , The URL shown for a link in the message (perhaps via a “tool tip”) does not match the institution’s real Web address. Fortunately there are ways in which software can help detect and block most phishing attempts.  A good spam filter is the first line of defense and can block many phishing messages from getting to the user in the first place.  Anti-phishing features are also increasingly included in Web browsers, or available as plug-ins.  Thus “blacklists” of known phishing sites can be checked in real time and warnings given, or the site’s address can be blocked from access by the system.  Web sites can also introduce an added layer of security: Bank of America, for example, asks users to select and label one of several images offered by the bank.  The image and label are subsequent displayed as part of the log-in process.  If the user does not see the image and the user’s label, then the site is presumably not the real bank site",0
"The PHP processor parses only the code within the delimiters <? and ?>.  (An alternative set of delimiters is <script language =‘php’> </script>. Besides being embedded in HTML pages, PHP can be used interactively at the command line, where it has replaced older languages such as awk, Perl, or shell scripting for many users.  PHP can also be linked to user-interface libraries (such as GTK+ for Linux/UNIX) to create applications that run on the client machine rather than the server. PHP has a basic set of data types plus one called “resource” that represents data processed by special functions that return images, text files, database records, and so on.  Additionally, PHP5 provides full support for objects, including private and protected member variables, constructors and destructors, and other features similar to those found in C++ and other languages. There are numerous libraries of open-source objects and functions that enable PHP scripts to perform common Internet tasks, including accessing database servers (such as MySQL) as well as extensions to the language to handle popular Web formats such as Adobe Flash animation.  Programmers have access to a wide range of PHP resources through PEAR (the PHP Extension and Application Repository). The combination of sophisticated features and easy interactive scripting has made PHP the language of choice for many Web developers, who use it as part of the group of technologies called LAMP, for Linux, Apache (Web server), MySQL (database), and PHP.

"Because of its many practical features and its availability for the popular IBM 360 mainframes, PL/I enjoyed considerable success in the late 1960s and 1970s.  The language was later ported to most major platforms and operating systems.  When personal computers came along, PL/I became available for IBM’s OS/2 operating system as well as for Microsoft’s DOS and Windows, although the language never really caught on in those environments. Computer scientists such as structured programming guru Edsger Dijkstra decried PL/I’s lack of a clear, welldefined structure.  In his Turing Award Lecture in 1972, Dijkstra opined that “I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language—our basic tool, mind you!—already escapes our intellectual control. ” (See Dijkstra, Edsger. )On a practical level the sheer number of features in the language meant that truly mastering it was a lengthy process.  A language like C, on the other hand, had a much simpler “core” to master even though it was less versatile.  PL/I also tended to retain the mainframe associations from its birth at IBM, while C grew up in the world of minicomputers and the UNIX community and proved more suitable for PCs.  Nevertheless, PL/I provided many examples that language designers could use in attempting to design better implementations. ",0
"By the mid-1990s, Intel was promoting a standard for the automated detection and configuration of devices.  Known as Plug and Play (PnP), this standard was incorporated in versions of Microsoft Windows starting with Windows 95 ,.  The required hardware support soon appeared on PC motherboards and expansion cards. With Plug and Play the user simply connects a printer, scanner, or other device to the PC.  Windows detects that a device has been connected and queries it for its official name and other information.  If necessary, Windows can then prompt the user for a disk containing the appropriate driver or even search for a driver on a Web site. The concept of Plug and Play extends beyond the Windows world, however.  In recent years there has been interest in developing a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol by which a variety of devices could automatically configure themselves with any of a variety of different networks.  This would be particularly helpful for home users who are increasingly setting up small networks so they can share broadband Internet connections, as well as the growing number of users who want their desktop PC to work with handheld (palm) computers and other devices.  Microsoft supports UPnP in versions of Windows starting with ME and XP. ",0
"A number of applications programs include the ability for third-party developers to write small programs that extend the main program’s functionality.  For example, thousands of “filters” (algorithms for transforming images) have been written for Adobe Photoshop.  These small programs are called plug-ins because they are designed to connect to the main program and provide their service whenever it is desired or required. Perhaps the most commonly encountered plug-ins are those available for Web browsers such as Firefox, Netscape, or Internet Explorer.  Plug-ins can enable the browser to display new types of files (such as multimedia).  Many standard programs for particular kinds of files are now provided both as stand-alone applications and as browser plug-ins.  Examples include Adobe (PDF document format), Apple QuickTime (graphics, video, and animation), RealPlayer (streaming video and audio), and Macromedia Flash (interactive animation and presentation).  These and many other plug-ins are offered free for the downloading, in order to increase the number of potential users for the formats and thus the market for the development packages. One of the most useful plug-ins found in most browsers is one that allows the browser to run Java applets ,.  In turn, Java is often used to write other plug-ins. Beyond such traditional workhorses, a number of innovative browser plug-ins have appeared, particularly for the increasingly popular Firefox browser.  For example, there are plug-ins that enable the user to view and work with the HTML and other elements of the page being viewed.  Another popular area is plug-ins that make it easier to capture and organize material from Web pages, going well beyond the standard favorites or bookmark facility. ",0
"Podcasting (from iPod plus broadcasting) lets users subscribe to and automatically download regularly distributed content (such as radio broadcasts) over the Internet.  The media files can be stored on an Apple iPod or other media player ,, personal computer, or other device ,.  Podcasting became popular starting around 2004–05 and has become widely used by individuals and organizations. Typically, files to be podcast are put on a Web server.  The URLs for the files and other information (such as episode titles) is provided in files called feeds, using a format such as RSS or Atom ,.  The user installs client software (such as iPodder), browses the feeds (such as through an online directory), and decides what to subscribe to.  The software then periodically checks the feeds, obtains the URLs of the latest files, and downloads them automatically.  The software can, if desired, then transfer the downloaded files to a portable media player, such as over a USB connection",0
"There are many sources of podcasts.  News organizations can provide regular audio or video podcasts as a supplement to regular text material.  Podcasting also offers a way for a small news organization or independent journalist to build an audience using equipment as simple as a microphone and perhaps a video camera.  Podcasts also provide a way for political organizations to keep in touch with supporters (and perhaps supply them with talking points).  Any source of periodically distributed audio or video can be a candidate for podcasting.  These include class lectures, corporate communications, and even religious services",0
"Early computer printers were limited to one or a few built-in fonts, either stamped on typewriter style keys on daisy wheels, or stored as patterns in the printer’s software (with dot matrix printers).  In the mid-1970s, when Xerox researchers were developing the laser printer, they realized they needed an actual programming language that could describe fonts, graphics, and other elements that could be printed on the more versatile new printers.  PARC researchers developed InterPress; meanwhile two of them, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, founded their own company in 1982 ,.  They then created a more streamlined version of InterPress that they called PostScript.  The first printer to include built-in PostScript capability was Apple’s LaserWriter, in 1985.  PostScript soon became the standard for a burgeoning industry ,. Because PostScript is an actual programming language (for a somewhat similar language, see Forth), software such as word processors can include functions that turn a text document into a PostScript document, ready for printing.  A PostScript interpreter in the printer (or even in another application) interprets the PostScript commands to re-create the document.  The commands specify rasters (combinations of straight lines and curves), which can be scaled and transformed to provide the specified output, including fonts, which can be enhanced by including “hints” to help the system identify key features.  This processor is thus sometimes called a Raster Image Processor (RIP)",0
"Whether at a business meeting or a scientific conference, the use of slides or transparencies has been largely replaced by software that can create a graphic presentation.  Generally, the user creates a series of virtual “slides,” which can consist of text (such as bullet points) and charts or other graphics.  Often there are templates already structured for various types of presentations, so the user only needs to supply the appropriate text or graphics.  There are a variety of options for the general visual style, as well as for transitions (such as dissolves) between slides.  Another useful feature is the ability to time the presentation and provide cues for the speaker.  Finished presentations can be shown on a standard monitor screen (if the audience is small) or output to a screen projectorMicrosoft PowerPoint is the most widely used presentation program.  It includes the ability to import Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, or other items created by Microsoft Office suite applications.  The user can switch between outline view (which shows the overall structure of the presentation) to viewing individual slides or working with the slides as a collection. There are a number of alternatives available including Apple’s Keynote and Open Office, which includes a presentation program comparable to PowerPoint.  Another alternative is to use HTML Web-authoring programs to create the presentation in the form of a set of linked Web pages.  (PowerPoint and other presentation packages can also convert their presentations to HTML. ) Although creating presentations in HTML may be more difficult than using a proprietary package and the results may be somewhat less polished, the universality of HTML and the ability to run presentations from a Web site are strong advantages of that approach.

"The large computers that first became available in the 1950s , used “line printers. ” These devices have one hammer for each column of the output.  A rapidly moving band of type moves under the hammers.  Each hammer strikes the band when the correct character passes by.  Printing is therefore done line by line, hence the name.  Line printers were fast (600 lines per minute or more) but like the mainframes they served, they were bulky and expensive. The typewriter offered another point of departure for designing printers.  A few early computers such as the BINAC (an offshoot of ENIAC) used typewriters rigged with magnetically controlled switches (solenoids).  However, a more natural fit was with the Teletype, invented early in the 20th century to print telegraph messages.  Since the Teletype is already designed to print from electrically transmitted character codes, it was easy to rig up a circuit to translate the contents of computer data into appropriate codes for printing.  (Since the Teletype could send as well as receive messages, it was often used as a control terminal for computer operators or for time-sharing computer users into the 1970s. )The daisy-wheel printer was another typewriter-like device.  It used a movable wheel with the letters embedded in slim “petals” (hence the name).  It was slow (about 10 characters a second), noisy, and expensive, but it was the only affordable alternative for early personal computer users who required “letter-quality” output. ",0
"The dot-matrix printer, which came into common use in the 1980s, uses a different principle of operation than typewriter-style printers.  Unlike the latter, the dot-matrix printer does not form solid characters.  Instead, it uses an array of magnetically controlled pins (9 pins at first, but 24 on later models).  Each character is formed by pressing the appropriate pins into a ribbon that pushes into the paper, leaving a pattern of tiny dots. Besides being relatively inexpensive, dot-matrix printers are versatile in that a great variety of character styles or fonts can be printed ,, either by loading different sets of bitmaps.  Likewise, graphic images can also be printed.  However, because the characters are made of tiny dots, they don’t have the crisp, solid look of printed type",0
"Good project management software provides many tools for the purpose.  Available charts and reports often include:,? Gantt charts that use bars to show the duration and percentage of completion of the various overlapping subprojects or tasks. , PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts that show each subproject or task as a rectangular “node” with information about the task.  The connections between nodes show the relationships (dependencies) between the items.  PERT charts are usually used at the beginning stages of planning. , Analysis tools that show critical paths and bottlenecks (places where one or more tasks falling behind might threaten large portions of the project).  Generally, the more preceding items a task is dependent on, the more likely that task is to fall behind. , Tools for estimating the probability for completion of a given task based on the probabilities of tasks it is dependent on, as well as other factors such as the likelihood of certain resources becoming available. , A system of alerts or “stoplights” that show slowdowns, potential problems, or areas where work has stopped completely.  These can be set to be triggered when various specified conditions occur. , Integration between project management and budget reporting so tasks and the project as a whole can be monitored in relation to budget constraints. , Integration between the project management software and individual schedules kept in PIM software such as Microsoft Outlook or in handheld computers (PDAs) such as the PalmPilot. , Integration between project management and software for scheduling meetin",0
"Computing is a complex, pervasive, and increasingly vital human activity.  It is not surprising that human psychology can play an important role in many aspects of computer use. Since the 1960s psychology (in particular see cognitivescience) has contributed to the structuring of interaction between computer systems and users ,.  It is important to note the significant differences between how computers and humans perceive and process information: computers are extremely fast in processing in a highly structured setting (e. g. , a program).  The human brain, on the other hand, while thousands of times slower, is thus far greatly superior in coping with loosely structured data through pattern recognition, the making of analogies, and generalization.  A number of researchers , have promoted the idea of creating a human-computer synergy where the structure of the system takes advantage of both the machine’s computational and data-retrieval abilities and the human user’s ability to work with the larger picture.  Such research is continuing as autonomous software , and is beginning to interact with Web user",0
"The Internet and its perception as a shared cyberspace adds new dimensions to the psychology of computing.  In fact, the emphasis here is not on computation per se but on the representation of ideas and images, communication, social interaction, and identity.  In particular, pioneering work , has illuminated ways in which online interactions affect identity and sense of self—even encouraging the assumption of multiple identities ,.  Indeed, virtual worlds such as Second Life offer new ways to study the formation of communities and social interactions. On the positive side, it has been argued that cyberspace has encouraged people (particularly adolescents) to experiment with new identities in a relatively safe environment, but lack of inhibition and experience can lead to risky behavior such as involvement with sexual predators.  The very fact that many people (particularly the young) may spend several hours a day or more immersed in the online world has also led to concerns; some psychologists have even suggested that “Internet addiction disorder” (IAD) be included as an official mental disorder similar to compulsive gambling.  However, as of 2007, the American Medical Association has not recommended that IAD be classified as a mental disorder, and the American Society of Addiction Medicine has resisted such a status.  Generally, excessive or inappropriate use of the Internet has been seen as a symptom of more traditional diagnoses such as obsession or compulsion. ",0
"Python is particularly useful for system administrators, webmasters, and other people who have to link various files, data source, or programs to perform their daily tasks.  The language currently has a small but growing (and quite enthusiastic) following. Without the semicolons and braces found in C and related languages, Python looks rather like BASIC.  Also note that the type of input data doesn’t have to be declared.  The runtime mechanism will assume it’s numeric from the expression found in the print statement.  Python programs thus tend to be shorter and simpler than C, Java, or even Perl programs.  The simple syntax and lack of data typing does not mean that Python is not a “serious” language, however.  Python contains full facilities for object-oriented programming, for example. Python programs can be written quickly and easily by trying commands out interactively and then converted the script to bytecode, a machine-independent representation that can be run on an interpreter designed for each machine environment.  Alternatively, there are translation programs that can convert a Python script to a C source file that can then be compiled for top speed. ",0
"By combining mirroring, error correction, and/or striping, different “levels” of RAID can be implemented to suit different needs.  There are various trade-offs: Striping can increase access speed, but uses more storage space and, by increasing the number of disks, also increases the chance that one will fail.  Implementing error correction can make failure recoverable, but slows data access down because data has to be read from more than one location and compared. The most commonly used RAID levels are:, RAID 0—striping data across disks, higher speed but no error correction; failure of any disk can make data unrecoverable, RAID 1—mirroring (data stored on at least two disks), data intact as long as one disk is still operating, RAID 3 and 4—striping plus a dedicated disk for parity (error checking), RAID 5—striping with distributed parity; data can be restored automatically after a failed disk is replaced, RAID 6—like RAID 5 but with parity distributed so that data remains intact unless more than two drives failIn actuality, RAID configurations can be very complex, where different levels can be “layered” above one another, with each treating the next as a virtual drive, until one gets down to the actual hardware.  Although RAID is often implemented using a physical (hardware) controller, operating systems can also create a virtual RAID structure in software, interposed between the logical drive as seen by the read/write routines and the physical drives.

"Back in the days of mechanical clocks, curious kids would sometimes take a clock apart to try to figure out how it worked.  A few were even able to reassemble the clock correctly—these youngsters were likely to become engineers! With software, reverse engineering is the process of “taking apart” software and analyzing its operation without having access to the program code itself.  Among other possibilities, reverse engineering may allow one to:, provide equivalent functions without violating copyright laws, emulate one operating system within another ,, determine a file format so other programs can use it as well (interoperability), document the operation of a program whose documentation is lost or no longer available, determine whether a competing product violates one’s patents or copyrights",0
"Passive RFID tags have no power supply; the power induced by the reading signal is used to transmit the response.  Because this power is very small, passive tags can only be read at distances from about 4 inches (10 cm) to a few yards (meters), depending on the antenna size and type.  The main advantage of passive tags is that the lack of a battery makes them small, lightweight, and inexpensive, making them ideal for attaching to merchandise (they have also been embedded under the skin of pets and, in a few cases, even people).  Smart cards for use in transit systems and similar applications are also passive; the system is activated by “tagging” or bringing the card near the reader. Active RFID tags have their own battery.  Their advantage is that they are able to initiate communication with the reader, and the signal they send is much stronger, more reliable, and with greater range (up to about 1,500 feet [500 m]).  The stronger signal allows for communication in rougher environments (such as outdoors for tracking cattle or shipping containers). ",0
"Current uses for RFID tags and cards of various types include:, automatic fare payments systems for transit systems, automatic toll payments for bridges and turnpikes, automatic book checkout systems for libraries, where it reduces repetitive strain injury (RSI) in staff and simplifies checking shelves, student ID cards, passports (RFID has been included in new U. S.  passports since 2006), tracking cattle, including determining the origin of unhealthy animals, identification chips placed beneath the skin of pets, experimental human RFID implants (pioneered by British computer scientist Kevin Warwick) and now used by VIP customers in a few nightclubs, tracking goods from original shipment to inventory (Wal-Mart now requires its major suppliers to include RFID labels with shipments), scientific sensors, such as seismographic instruments",0
"The benefits of RFID technology are numerous: better inventory control ,; more secure passports and other forms of ID; faster, easier access to transportation systems; and potentially, the avoidance of mishaps in hospitals, such as the wrong patient receiving a drug or procedure. However, there are privacy and security concerns that remain to be fully resolved.  The primary threat is that unauthorized persons could illicitly obtain information or track people or goods, for purposes ranging from simple larceny to identity theft.  Privacy rights organizations have also raised concerns that information about consumer purchases could be used for unwanted marketing (or sold to third parties), while information about a library patron’s reading habits could trigger unwarranted government investigations in the name of fighting terrorism. There is an incentive to produce RFID cards and tags that are resistant to unauthorized reading or tampering.  A cryptographic protocol can be used such that no information will be sent or received unless the reader and tag “know” the correct keys.  Another possibility is to create a device that can “jam” reading attempts in the device’s vicinity, perhaps protecting a customer’s grocery cart from being scanned.  Finally, RFID cards can be put inside in a sleeve of material that blocks the signals.  However, cryptographic and other security technologies raise the cost of RFID devices and may make them impracticable for some applications. In September 2006 the National Science Foundation awarded a $1. 1 million grant to the RFID Consortium for Security and Privacy to study potential risks and safeguards for the technology.  That same year a group of major corporations together with the National Consumers League released a draft set of standards and guidelines for best practices in using RFID, with broader scope than the existing EPC (electronic product code) standard",0
"Programmers and managers of software development are generally aware of the need for software to properly deal with erroneous data ,.  They know that any significant program will have bugs that must be rooted out ,.  Good software engineering practices and a systematic approach to assuring the reliability and quality of software can minimize problems in the finished product ,.  However, serious bugs are not always caught, and sometimes the consequences can be catastrophic.  For example, in the Therac 25 computerized X-ray cancer treatment machine, poorly thought-out command entry routines plus a counter overflow resulted in three patients being killed by massive X-ray overdoses.  The overdoses ultimately occurred because the designers had removed a physical interlock mechanism they believed was no longer necessary. Any computer application is part of a much larger environment of humans and machines, where unforeseen interactions can cause problems ranging from inconvenience to loss of privacy to potential injury or death.  Seeing these potential pitfalls requires thinking beyond the specifications and needs of a particular project.  For many years the Usenet newsgroup comp. risks (and its collected form, Risks Digest) have chronicled what amounts to an ongoing symposium where knowledgeable programmers, engineers, and others have pointed out potential risks in new technology and suggested ways to minimize them",0
"In 1921, the Czech playwright Karel Capek wrote a play called R. U. R.  or Rossum’s Universal Robots.  Robot is a Czech word that has been translated as work(er), serf, or slave.  In the play the robots, which are built by factories to work in other factories, eventually revolt against their human masters. During the 1960s, real robots began to appear in factory settings ,.  They were an outgrowth of earlier machine tools that had been programmed by cams and other mechanisms.  An industrial robot is basically a movable arm that ends in a “hand” called an end effector.  The arm and hand can be moved by some combination of hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, or mechanical means.  Typical applications include assembling parts, welding, and painting.  The robot is programmed for a task either by giving it a detailed set of commands to move to, grasp, and manipulate objects, or by “training” the robot by moving its arm, hand, and effectors through the required motions, which are then stored in the robot’s memory.  By the early 1970s, Unimation, Inc.  had created a profitable business from selling its Unimate robots to factories. The early industrial robots had very little ability to respond to variations in the environment, such as the “work piece” that the robot was supposed to grasp being slightly out of position.  However, later models have more sophisticated sensors to enable them to adjust to variations and still accomplish the task.  The more sophisticated computer programs that control newer robots have internal representations or “frames of reference” to keep track of both the robot’s internal parameters (angles, pressures, and so on) and external locations in the work area",0
"Industrial robots work in an extremely restricted environment, so their world representation can be quite simple.  However, robots that can move about in the environment have also been developed.  Military programs have developed automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) with wheels or tracks, capable of navigating a battlefield and scouting or attacking the enemy ,.  Space-going robots including the Sojourner Mars rover also have considerable onboard “intelligence,” although their overall tasks are programmed by remote commands. Indeed, the extent to which mobile robots are truly autonomous varies considerably.  At one end is the “robot” that is steered and otherwise controlled by its human operator, such as law enforcement robots that can be sent into dangerous hostage situations.  (Another example is the robots that fight in arena combat in the popular Robot Warsshows. )",0
"Moving toward greater autonomy, we have the “service robots” that have begun to show up in some institutions such as hospitals and laboratories.  These mobile robots are often used to deliver supplies.  For example, the HelpMate robot can travel around a hospital by itself, navigating using an internal map.  It can even take an elevator to go to another floor. Service robots have had only modest market penetration, however.  They are relatively expensive and limited in function, and if relatively low-wage more versatile human labor is available, it is generally preferred.  For now mobile robots and service robots are most likely to turn up in specialized applications in environments too dangerous for human workers, such as in the military, law enforcement, handling of hazardous materials, and so on.

"IBM did succeed in creating RPG (Report Program Generator), a language designed to make it easier for programmers (including beginners) to generate business reports. Most COBOL programs read data, perform tests and calculations, and print the results.  RPG, first released in 1964 for use with the new System/360 mainframe and the smaller System/3, simplifies this process and eliminates most writing of program code statements. A “classic” RPG program is built around the “RPGcycle,” consisting of three stages.  During the input stage, the input device(s), file type, access specifications, and data record structure are specified.  (These specifications can be quite elaborate. ) The heart of the program specifies calculations to be performed with the various data fields, while the output section specifies how the results will be laid out in report form, including such things as headers, footers, and sections. Subsequent versions of RPG added more features.  RPGIV, released in 1994, includes the ability to define subroutines, for example.  IBM has also released VisualAge RPG, which allows for the creation and running of RPG programs in the Microsoft Windows environment.  There are also tools for interfacing RPG programs with various database systems and to use RPG for writing Web-based (CGI) programs",0
"Web sites such as news providers and blogs , are constantly posting new material.  While readers can periodically visit a site to look for new material, an increasingly popular option is to subscribe to a “Web feed” and receive the latest information automatically.  The most commonly used tool for Web feeds is RSS, which can stand for Really Simple Syndication, Rich Site Summary, or RDF Site Summary, depending on the format used. The data in an RSS feed can include article titles, summaries, excerpts (such as the first paragraph), or the complete article or posting.  Feeds can also include multimedia such as graphics, video, or sound.  The data (and any linked material) is formatted using standard markup elements ,.  As part of the process of setting up a feed on the Web server, the feed is “published” so that it can be found and read using a client program called a reader or aggregator (the latter can combine feeds or organize them in a newspaper-like format for convenience).  RSS readers can be stand-alone applications or be included with many modern Web browsers and e-mail clients.  Alternatively, Webbased readers or aggregators such as NewsGator Online can allow feeds to be read using any Web browser.  Readers of Web pages can find RSS feeds by looking for a “subscribe” icon or the words RSS or XML.  Specialized search engines such as Bloglines can also help users find interesting feeds.  Additionally, information on the server can also be used by software to automatically deliver the latest content",0
"Forerunners of RSS go back to the mid-1990s, with RDF Site Summary first appearing in 1999 for use on Netscape’s portal.  The adoption of RSS by the New York Times in 2002 greatly aided the popularization of the format, as did the growing number of blogs that needed a way for contributors and readers to keep in touch.  Today Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari support RSS.  File-sharing services such as BitTorrent can be combined with RSS to deliver content automatically to users’ hard drives.  An offshoot of RSS called Atom has been less widely adopted, but offers better compatibility with XML standards and better management of multimedia content",0
"Rich Text Format was developed in the later 1980s by programmers at Microsoft.  Its purpose is to allow for interchange of documents between Microsoft Word and other software, while preserving the original formatting. An RTF file is itself a plain text file containing the document text enclosed in control codes that determine the formatting. Although RTF is an 8-bit format, special escape sequences can be used to specify 16-bit Unicode characters, such as for non-Roman alphabets. Libraries and utilities are available for reading and writing RTF from most popular programming languages, including Perl, PHP, and Ruby. In practice, RTF created by word processors tends to contain many control codes needed to ensure compatibility with older programs, making the files bulky and not practicable to edit directly.  However, saving a file in RTF is a good way to ensure that a document can be used by recipients who may have, for example, older versions of Word. ",0
"Ruby is a versatile yet consistent programming language that has become popular in recent years, particularly for Web development.  Designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto and first released in 1995, Ruby has a compact syntax familiar to many users of Perl and other scripting languages ,, avoiding, for example, the need to declare variable types.  However, Ruby is also a thoroughgoing object-oriented language somewhat like Smalltalk ,.  Matsumoto has stressed that the design of the language is intended to stress being natural and enjoyable for the programmer, rather than focusing on the needs of the machine",0
"The most popular programming environment for Ruby is Ruby on Rails, an open-source application framework aimed particularly at writing programs that connect Web sites to databases.  The framework is based on the model view controller approach (separating data access and logic from the user interface) and includes “scaffolding” that can be quickly filled in to provide data-driven Web sites with basic functionality.  Developers can also create plug-ins to extend the built-in packages",0
"SAP (NYSE symbol: SAP) is a German acronym for Systeme, Anwendungen, und Produkete in der Datenverarbeitung (“Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing”).  Five former IBM engineers in Germany founded the company in 1972. Although unfamiliar to the American public, unlike IBMand Microsoft, SAP is the world’s largest business software company, and fourth-largest software provider in general (behind Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle).  The company operates worldwide through three geographical divisions. ",0
"SAP specializes in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), enhancing a corporation’s ability to manage its key assets and needs and to plan for the future.  This software consists of three tiers: the database, an application server, and the client.  Early versions of this software were designed to run on mainframes.  Other major products include:, SAP NetWeaver, which integrates all other SAP modules using modern open-standard Web technologies ,, Customer Relationship Manager ,, Supply Chain Management ,, Supplier Relationship Management, Human Resource Management System, Product Lifestyle ManagementExchange Infrastructure, Enterprise Portal, SAP Knowledge Warehouse",0
"SAP has recognized for some time that while its base of large Fortune 500 companies has given it steady income, changing trends in business have been limiting the software giant’s growth.  In particular, the trend has been toward smaller, simpler, more scalable applications that can be integrated with modern Web services.  In September 2007 SAP announced SAP Business ByDesign, a flexible set of enterprise management services that are delivered over the Web.  However, it remains to be seen how well SAP will be able to compete with more agile companies such as NetSuite and Salesforce. com, and whether the company will be able to upgrade its existing large company user base without disaffecting it. SAP’s major competitor in the United States is Oracle ,, which has sued SAP in 2007 for unfairly downloading and using patches and support materials from Oracle and using them to support former Oracle customers.  SAP and Oracle have generally had quite different growth strategies: SAP grows by expanding and extending its own products, while Oracle has grown mainly through acquiring other companies.  However, in October 2007 SAP acquired Business Objects, a leader in “business intelligence” systems, for $6. 8 billion.  This may signal SAP’s willingness to engage in further strategic acquisitions",0
"In order for a computer to work with information, the information must be digitized—converted to data that application programs can recognize and manipulate ,.  Computer users have thus been confronted with the task of converting millions of pages of printed words or graphics into machine-readable form.  Since it is expensive to re-key text (and impractical to redraw images), some way is needed to automatically convert the varying shades or colors of the text or images into a digitized graphics image that can be stored in a file. This is what a scanner does.  The scanner head contains a charge-coupled device (CCD) like that used in digital cameras ,.  The CCD contains thousands or millions of tiny regions that can convert incoming light into a voltage level.  Each of these voltage levels, when amplified, will correspond to one pixel of the scanned image.  (A color scanner uses three different diodes for each pixel, each receiving light through a red, green, or blue filter. )",0
"The operation of the head depends on the type of scanner.  In the most common type, the flatbed scanner, a motor moves the head back and forth across the paper, which lies facedown on a glass window.  In a sheet-fed scanner, the head remains stationery and the paper is fed past it by a set of rollers.  Finally, there are handheld scanners, where the job of moving the scanner head is performed by the user moving the scanner back and forth over the page. ",0
"The resolution of a scanner depends on the number of pixels into which it can break the image.  The color depth depends on how many bits of information that it can store per pixel (more information means more gradations of color or gray).  Resolutions of 2,400 dots per inch (dpi) or more are now common, with up to 36 bit color depth, allowing for about 68. 7 billion colors or gradations ,Besides considerations of resolution and color depth, the quality of a scanned image depends on the quality of the scanner’s optics as well as on how the page or other object reflects light.  As anyone who has browsed eBay listings knows, the quality of scans can vary considerably.  Most scanners come with software that allows for the scanner to be controlled and adjusted from the PC, and image-editing software can be used to further adjust the scanned image",0
"These general principles also apply to systems where more than one processor is available ,, but there is the added complication of deciding where the scheduling program will be run.  In a multiprocessing system that has one “master” and many “slave” processors, the scheduling program runs on the master processor.  This arrangement is simple, but it means that when a slave processor wants to schedule a program it must wait until the scheduling program gets its next time-slice on the master processor. One alternative is to allow any processor that has free time to run the scheduling algorithm.  This is harder to set up because it requires a mechanism to make sure two processors do not try to run the scheduling program at the same time, but it smoothes out the bottleneck that would arise from relying on a single processor. ",0
"o trends in recent years have changed the emphasis in scheduling algorithms.  One is the continuing drop in price per unit of processing power and memory.  This means that maximum efficiency in using the hardware can often give way in favor of catering to the user’s convenience and perceptions by giving more priority to interaction with the user.  The other development is the growing use of systems where much of the burden of graphics and interactivity is placed on the user’s desktop, thus simplifying the complexity of sch",0
"From microbiology to plasma physics, modern science would be impossible without the computer.  This is not because the computer has replaced the scientific method of observation, hypothesis, and experiment.  Modern scientists essentially follow the same intellectual procedures at did Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein.  Rather, understanding of the layered systems that make up the universe has now reached so complex and detailed a level that there is too much data for an individual human mind to grasp.  Further, the calculations necessary to process the data usually can’t be performed by unaided humans in any reasonable length of time.  This can be caused either by the inherent complexity of the calculation , or the sheer amount of data (as in DNA sequencing; see bioinformatics and data mining)",0
"Even if scientists have a basic understanding of a system, it may be hard to determine what the overall results of the interaction of the many particles (or other elements) in the system will be.  This is true, for example, in the analysis of events taking place in nuclear reactors.  Fortunately computers can apply the laws of the system to each of many particles and determine the resulting actions from their aggregate behavior ,.  Simulation is particularly important in fields where actual experiments are not possible because of distance or time.  Thus, a hypothesis about the formation of the universe can be tested by applying it to a set of initial conditions believed to reflect those at or near the time of the big bang. However, even the most skilled scientists have trouble relating numbers to the shape and interaction of real-world objects.  Computers have greatly aided in making it possible to visualize structures and phenomena using high-resolution 3D color graphics ,.  Features of interest can be enhanced, and arbitrary (“false”) colors can be used to visually show such things as temperature or blood flow.  These techniques can also be used to create interactive models where scientists can, for example, combine molecules in new ways and have the computer calculate the likely properties of the result.  Finally, computer visualization and modeling can be used both to teach science and to give the general public some visceral grasp of the meaning of scientific theories and discoveries",0
"By the mid-1990s, many thousands of pages were being added to the World Wide Web each day ,.  The availability of graphical browsing programs such as Mosaic, Netscape, and Microsoft Internet Explorer , made it easy for ordinary PC users to view Web pages and to navigate from one page to another.  However, people who wanted to use the Web for any sort of systematic research found they needed better tools for finding the desired information. There are basically three approaches to exploring the Web: casual “surfing,” portals, and search engines.  A user might find (or hear about) an interesting Web page devoted to a business or other organization or perhaps a particular topic.  The page includes a number of featured links to other pages.  The user can follow any of those links to reach other pages that might be relevant.  Those pages are likely to have other interesting links that can be followed, and so on.  Most Web users have surfed in this way: It can be fun and it can certainly lead to “finds” that can be bookmarked for later reference.  However, this approach is not systematic, comprehensive, or efficient. Alternatively, the user can visit a site such as the famous Yahoo! started by Jerry Yang and David Filo ,.  These sites specialize in selecting what their editors believe to be the best and most useful sites for each topic, and organizing them into a multilevel topical index.  The portal approach has several advantages: The work of sifting through the Web has already been done, the index is easy to use, and the sites featured are likely to be of good quality.  However, even Yahoo!’s busy staff can examine only a tiny portion of the estimated 1 trillion or so Web pages being presented on about 175 million different Web sites (as of 2008).

"The ever-growing World Wide Web consists of billions of linked HTML documents (and other resources), but most of the links contain no information about why the linkage has been made or what it might mean.  Services such as Google can automatically trace the links and index each page , with the aid of “metadata” such as keywords that summarize page content.  However, discovering the relationships between data items on pages, or between pages—and their meaning, or semantics—requires human scrutiny. In his 1999 book Weaving the Web, World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee , described a new way in which Web pages might be organized in the future:I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web—the content, links, and transactions between people and computers.  A “Semantic Web,” which should make this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines.  The “intelligent agents” people have touted for ages will finally materialize. In other words, by encoding definitions of objects and their relationships into the text of Web pages, programs , can be written to use this information to answer sophisticated questions such as “which devices from this vendor use open-source software?”",0
"The semantic Web is not something that can appear overnight—after all, it will take considerable human effort to encode the information needed for machines to understand Web resources, and additional effort to code the application programs that will take advantage of that information.  However, the potential payoff is huge, allowing both human and automated searchers to tackle much more sophisticated tasks. For example, the University of Maryland is developing a prototype semantic search engine called Swoogle.  It can extract information and determine relationships between documents that include RDF or OWL elements.  Swoogle can also help users find appropriate ontologies for exploring a subject ,. Much research needs to be done.  For example, there is the problem of deriving a measure of “reliability” or “trust” based on the data sources used to answer the query, which may be scattered all over the world and represent very different kind",0
"A growing number of people 50 and older have been learning how to use computer technology and especially applications such as e-mail and Web browsing.  However, a substantial number of seniors have expressed reluctance to join the digital world—as of January 2006, the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that only 34 percent of persons 65 and over were online.  Some reasons why seniors have avoided the technology include the following:, the belief that it would be too hard to learn to use it, uncertainty about what can be done online and whether it is worth the effort, fear of well-publicized dangers such as viruses and identity theft, the expense of a personal computer and Internet accessFortunately a number of these factors are gradually being ameliorated.  There are numerous books and courses (such as at adult education or senior centers) that introduce the essentials of computing to seniors.  Properly installed security and filtering software, together with some user education, can minimize the chances of being victimized online.  Finally, Internet-capable PCs are now available for around $300 or less, though the cost of broadband access has not fallen as rapidly as that of hardware. ",0
"There are basically two ways to move data from a computer to or from a peripheral device such as a printer or modem.  A byte (8 bits) of data can be moved all at once, with each bit traveling along its own wire ,.  Alternatively, a single wire can be used to carry the data one bit at a time.  Such a connection is called a serial port. The serial port receives data a full byte at a time from the computer bus and uses a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) to extract the bits one at a time and send them through the port.  A corresponding circuit at the other end accumulates the incoming bits and reassembles them into data bytes. The data bits for each byte are preceded by a start-bit to signal the beginning of the data and terminated by an stopbit.  Depending on the application, an additional bit may be used for parity ,.  Devices connected by a serial port must “negotiate” by requesting a particular connection speed and parity setting.  Failure to agree results in gibberish being received. ",0
"The official standard for serial transmission is called RS232C.  It defines various additional pins to which wires are connected, such as for synchronization (specifying when the device is ready to send or receive data) and ground.  Physically, the old-style connectors are called DB-25 because they contain 25 pins (many of which are not used).  Most newer PCs have DB-9 (i. e.  nine pin) connectors.  A “gender changer” can be used in cases where two devices both have male connectors (with pins) or female connectors (with corresponding sockets). Because they use a single data transmission line and include error-correction, serial cables can be longer than parallel cables (25 feet or more, as opposed to 10–12 feet).  Serial transmission is generally slower (at up to 115,200 bits/second) than parallel transmission.  Serial connections have generally been used for such devices as modems (whose speed is already limited by phone line characteristics), keyboards, mice, and some older printers.  Today the faster and more flexible USB , is replacing serial connections for many devices including even keyboards",0
"In 1982, Andrew Fuegelman created a program called PC-Talk.  This program provided a better way for users with modems to connect to the many bulletin board systems that were starting to spring up.  Fluegelman was familiar with the common practice of public radio and TV broadcasters of soliciting pledge payments to help support their “free” service.  He decided to do something similar with his program.  He distributed it to many bulletin boards, where users could download it for free.  However, he asked users who liked the program and wanted to continue to use it to pay him $25. Fluegelman dubbed his method of software distribution “freeware” (because it cost nothing to try out the program).  Other programmers began to use the same method with their own software.  This included Jim Knopf, author of the PC-File database program, and Bob Wallace, who offered PC-Write as a full-featured alternative to expensive commercial word processing program.  Because Fluegelman had trademarked the term freeware, these other authors began to call their offerings shareware. Today freeware means software that can be downloaded at no cost and for which there is no charge for continued use.  The program may be redistributed by users as long as they don’t charge for it",0
"To see a simple shell in action, a Windows user need only bring up a command prompt, type the word dir, and press Enter.  A shell called command. com provides the user interface for users of IBM PC-compatible systems running MS-DOS.  The command processor displays a prompt on the screen.  It then interprets , the user’s commands.  If the command involves one of the shell’s internal operations (such as “dir” to list a file directory), it simply executes that routine.  For example the command:dir temp /pwould be interpreted as a call to execute the dir function, passing it the name “temp” (a directory) and the /p, which dir interprets as a “switch” or instruction telling it to pause the directory listing after each screenful of text.  If the command is an external MS-DOS utility such as “xcopy” (a file copying program), the shell runs that program, passing it the information (mainly file names) from the command line.  Finally, the shell can run any other executable program on the system.  It is then that program’s responsibility to interpret and act upon any additional information that was provided. MS-DOS also has the ability for the command. com shell to read a series of commands stored in a text file called a batch file, and having the *. bat (batch) extension.  This allowed for rudimentary scripting of system housekeeping operations or other routine tasks ,. ",0
"A simulation is a simplified (but adequate) model that represents how a system works.  The system can be an existing, real-world one, such as a stock market or a human heart, or a proposed design for a system, such as a new factory or even a space colony. If a system is simple enough (a cannonball falling from a height, for example), it is possible to use formulas such as those provided by Newton to get an exact answer.  However, many real-world systems involve many discrete entities with complex interactions that cannot be captured with a single equation.  During the 1940s, scientists encountered just this problem in attempting to understand what would happen under various conditions in a nuclear reaction. Together with physicist Enrico Fermi, two mathematicians, John von Neumann , and Stanislaw Ulam, devised a new way to simulate complex systems.  Instead of trying fruitlessly to come up with some huge formula to “solve” the whole system, they applied probability formulas to each of a number of particles—in effect, “rolling the dice” for each one and then observing their resulting distribution and behavior.  Because of its analogy to gambling, this became known as the Monte Carlo method.  It turned out to be widely useful not only for simulating nuclear reactions and particle physics but for many other activities (such as bombing raids or the spread of disease) where many separate things behave according to probabilities. ",0
"Simulations and simulation techniques are used for a tremendous range of applications today.  Besides helping with the understanding of natural systems in physics, chemistry, biology, or engineering, simulation techniques are also applied to human behavior.  For example, the behavior of consumers or traders in a stock market can be explored with a simulation based on game theory concepts.  Artificial intelligence techniques (such as expert systems) can be used to give the individual “actors” in a simulation more realistic behavior. Simulations are often used in training.  A modern flight simulator, for example, not only simulates the aerodynamics of a plane and its response to the environment and to control inputs, but detailed graphics (and simulated physical motion) can make such training simulations feel very realistic, if not quite to Star Trek holodeck standards.  Whether for flight, military exercises, or stock trading, simulations can provide a much wider range of experiences in a relatively short time than would be feasible (or safe) using the real-world activity.  Simulations can also play an important part in testing software or systems or in predicating the results of business decisions or strategies. Simulations are also frequently sold as entertainment.  Many commercial strategy and role-playing games as well as vehicle simulators contain surprisingly complex simulations that make the games both absorbing and challenging ,.  Such games can also have considerable educational value. ",0
"Some typical features of a smart building include the following:, lighting that is controlled by time of day, scheduling, and occupancy sensors, temperature and air-flow sensors to determine the amount of cooling, heating, or fresh air needed, controls for central heating, hot water, and air conditioning systems, optimizing efficiency and minimizing energy use, alarms for intrusion, fire, carbon monoxide/dioxide, and other hazards, alarms indicating failure or unsafe operating conditions for various devices, integration of alarm and status messages with communications systems, enabling users to receive them by e-mail, text message, phone, or other means",0
"The smart card is the next generation of transaction devices.  Magnetically coded credit, debit, and ATM cards have been in use for many years.  These cards contain a magnetic strip encoded with a small amount of fixed data to identify the account.  All the actual data (such as account balances) is kept in a central server, which is why credit cards must be validated and transactions approved through a phone (modem) link.  Some magnetic strip cards such as those used in rapid transit systems are rewritable, so that, for example, the fare for the current ride can be deducted.  Telephone cards work the same way.  Nevertheless, these cards are essentially passive tokens containing a small amount of data.  They have little flexibility. However, since the mid-1970s it has been possible to put a microprocessor and rewritable memory into a card the size of a standard credit card.  These smart cards can store a hundred or more times the data of a magnetic strip card.  Further, because they have an onboard computer ,, they can interact with a computer at the point of service, exchanging and updating information",0
"Besides the microprocessor and associated circuitry, the smart card contains a small amount of RAM (random access memory) to hold “scratch” data during processing, as well as up to 64 kB of ROM (read-only memory) containing the card’s programming instructions.  The program is created on a desktop computer and written to the ROMthat is embedded in the card.  Finally, the card includes up to 64 kB of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) for holding account balances and other data.  This memory is nonvolatile (meaning that no power is needed to maintain it), and can be erased and rewritten by the card reader. “Contact” cards must be swiped through the reader and are most commonly used in retail, phone, pay TV, or health care applications.  “Contactless” cards need only be brought into the proximity of the reader, which communicates with it via radio signals or a low-powered laser beam.  Contactless cards are more practical for applications such as collecting bridge tolls ,. The card reader (or terminal) at the point of sale contains its own computer, which runs software that requests particular services from the card’s program, including providing identifying information and balances, updating balances, and so on.

"Some of the major smartphone manufacturers and their operating systems include the following:, Symbian (Symbian OS), used by Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, and others, Windows Mobile (enhanced Windows CE), popular in phones used in Asia, Blackberry (RIM), the popular PDA/smartphone, Linux, used as the base on which to build a variety of PDA/phone operating systems, including products from Motorola, Palm, and Nokia (Maemo), OS X (Apple), used in Apple’s innovative and very popular iPhone",0
"Originally standing for Simple Object Access Protocol, but now no longer an acronym, SOAP is a standard way to access Web services ,.  In today’s Web, where what appears to users to be a single site or application is usually built from many services, such a facility is essential. Prior to SOAP, Web applications usually communicated through remote procedure calls (RPC).  However there were problems with compatibility of applications running under different operating systems (and perhaps using different programming languages), as well as security problems that often led to such facilities being blocked. SOAP, on the other hand, uses the same HTTP recognized by all Web servers and browsers ,—indeed, it can also use secure HTTP (https). A SOAP request (or message) is an ordinary XML file , that includes an “envelope” element specifying it to be a SOAP message, an optional header, a body element containing the information pertaining to the function or transaction requested, and an optional fault element to specify error processing.  After receiving the message, the destination server returns a message providing the requested information. ",0
"Today, millions of people—middle, high school, and college students, but increasingly adults as well—have pages on popular Web sites such as MySpace and Facebook.  These sites are significant examples of social networking: the use of Web sites and communications and collaboration technology to help people find, form, and maintain social relationships. The origins of social networking can be traced to online venues that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, notably Usenet and, later, online chat boards ,.  In the late 1990s social networking Web sites began to appear, including Classmates. com (helping people find and communicate with former schoolmates) and SixDegrees. com, which emphasized “knows someone who knows someone who .  .  . ” kinds of links. By the mid-2000s the two biggest sites were Facebook and MySpace.  Founded in 2006 by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook was originally restricted to Harvard students, but eventually became open to any college student, and then high schools and even places of employment.  (The name comes from a book given to incoming students in some schools to familiarize them with their peers. ) As of late 2007 Facebook had more than 55 million active members and had become the seventh most visited of all Web sites",0

"Sony Corporation (NYSE symbol: SNE) is the electronics business unit of Sony Group, a large Japanese multinational company that plays a leading role in worldwide electronics, games, and entertainment media (movies and music), introducing and shaping many now-familiar standards. The company traces its origin to a radio repair shop started by Masaru Ibuka in a bombed-out building in Tokyo in 1945.  He was soon joined by Akio Morita, and the men started an electronics company whose name translates in English to Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation.  They started by building tape recorders, but in the early 1950s the two entrepreneurs were among the earliest to realize the potential of the transistor, marketing transistor radios starting in 1956.  The devices essentially established the modern consumer electronics field, perfectly fitting with a new music fad among American teenagers—rock and roll. With their marketing success, Ibuka and Morita realized that they needed a simple, catchy name that would appeal to Americans and other non-Japanese customers.  In 1958 they came up with Sony.  Although the name did not exist in any language (and thus could be made proprietary), “Sony” evokes English words such as “sound” and “sonic. ” (It also resembled a Japanese slang phrase “sony-sony,” for something like what we would call “geeks” or “nerds” today. )",0

In 1994 the company introduced the PlayStation, followed by later models in 2000 and 2006.  Sony is also a significant seller of digital cameras, including the Mavica floppy disc (later CD), since discontinued.  The company also introduced its proprietary “memory stick” for storage",0
"The simplest and least efficient kind of sort is called the selection sort.  Rather like a bridge player organizing a hand, the selection sort involves finding the record with the lowest key and swapping it with the first record, then scanning back through for the next lowest key and swapping it with the second record, and so on until all the records are sorted.  While this uses memory very efficiently (since the records are sorted in place), it is not only slow, but also gets worse fast.  That is, the time taken to sort n records is proportional to n2. The selection approach suffers because on each pass the sort determines not only the record with the lowest key but 446? ? ? ? sorting and searchingthe one with the next lowest key.  However, that information is not retained.  The heapsort, invented by John Williams in 1964, uses a binary tree to store a heap of sorted records ,.  Once the heap is built, the tree nodes can be used to store record numbers in a corresponding array that will represent the sorted database.  The heapsort is efficient because no records are physically moved, and the only memory needed is for the heap and array.  The heapsort is generally considered the fastest and most reliable general-purpose sorting algorithm, with a maximum running time of log n",0
"The bubble sort is based on making comparisons and swaps.  It makes the most convenient comparison possible: each record with its neighbor.  The algorithm looks at the first two records.  If the second has a lower key than the first, the records are swapped.  The procedure continues with the second and third records, then the third and fourth, and so on through all the records, swapping pairs of adjacent records whenever they are out of order.  After one pass the record with highest key will have “bubbled up to” the end of the list.  The procedure is then repeated for all but the last record until the two highest records are at the end, and so on until all the records are sorted.  Unfortunately, the number of comparisons and swaps that must be made makes the bubble sort as slow as the selection sort. ",0
"The quicksort improves on the basic bubble sort by first choosing a record with a key approximately midway between the lowest and highest.  This key is called the pivot.  The records are then moved to the left of the pivot if they are lower than it, and to the right if higher (that is, the records are divided into two partitions).  The process is then repeated to split the left side with a new pivot, and then the right side likewise.  This is continued until the partition size is one, and the records are now all sorted.  (Because of this repeated partitioning, quicksort is usually implemented using a procedure that calls itself repeatedly—see recursion. )Devised by C.  A.  R.  Hoare in 1962, quicksort is much faster than the bubble sort because records are moved over greater distances in a single operation rather than simply being exchanged with their neighbors.  Assuming an appropriate initial pivot value is chosen, running time is proportional to the logarithm of n rather than to the square of n. The difference becomes dramatic as the size of the database increases",0
"The bubble sort and quicksort are designed to work with records that are in random order.  However, in many applications a database grows slowly over time.  At any given time the existing database is already sorted, so it hardly makes sense to have to resort the whole database each time a new record is added. Instead, an insertion sort can be used.  In its simplest form, the algorithm looks sequentially through the sorted records until it finds the first record whose key is higher than that of the new record.  The new record can then be inserted just before that record, much like the way a bridge player might organize the cards in a hand.  (Since inserting a record and physically moving all the higher records up in memory can be time-consuming, a linked list of key values and associated record number is often used instead.  (See list processing. ) That way only the links need to be changed rather than any records being moved. The insertion sort was improved by Donald L.  Shell in 1959.  His “shellsort” takes a recursive approach (like that in the quicksort), and applies the insertion sort procedure to successively smaller partitions. Another improvement on the insertion sort is the mergesort.  As the name implies, this approach begins by creating two small lists of sorted records (using a simple comparison algorithm), then merging the lists into longer lists.  Merging is accomplished by looking at the two keys on the top of two lists and taking whichever is lowest until the lists are exhausted.  The merge sort also lends itself to a recursive approach, and it is comparable in speed and stability to the heapsort",0
"All of the sorting algorithms discussed so far rely upon some form of comparison.  However, it also possible to sort records by calculating their relative positions or distribution ,.  In its simplest form, an array can be created whose range of indexes is equal to 1 to the maximum possible key value.  Each key is then stored in the index position equal to its value (that is, a record with a key of 2314 would be stored in the array at position Array[2314].  This procedure works well, but only if the keys are all integers, the range is small enough to fit in memory, and there are no duplicate keys (since a duplicate would in effect overwrite the record already stored in that position). A more practical approach is to use a formula (hash function) that should create a unique hash value for each key.  The function must be chosen to minimize “collisions” where two keys end up with the same hash value, which creates the same problem as with duplicate keys.  A hash sort is quite efficient within those constraints",0
"There are a number of ways that sound can be sampled, stored, or generated digitally ,.  Here we will look at some of the most popular sound file formats. WAVThe WAV (wave) file format is specific to Microsoft Windows.  It essentially stores the raw sample data that represents the digitized audio content, including information about the sampling rate (which in turns affects the sound quality).  Since WAV files are not compressed, they can consume considerable disk space. AIFFAIFF stands for Audio Interchange File Format, and is specific to the Apple Macintosh and to Silicon Graphics (SGI) platforms.  Like WAV, it stores actual sound sample data.  A variant, AIFF-C, can store compressed sound. AUThe AU (audio) file format was developed by Sun Microsystems and is used mainly on UNIX systems, and also in Java programming. MIDIMIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface.  Unlike most other sound formats, MIDI files don’t represent sampled sound data.  Rather, they represent virtual musical instruments that synthesize sound according to complex algorithms that attempt to mirror the acoustic characteristics of real pianos, guitars, or other instruments.  Since MIDI is like a “score” for the virtual instruments rather than storing the sounds, it is much more compact than sampled sound formats.  MIDI is generally used for music composition rather than casual listening. MP3MP3 is actually a component of the MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group) multimedia standard, and stands for MPEG1 Audio Layer 3.  It is now the most popular sound format, using compression to provide a balance of sound quality",0
"While spam can appear in any communications medium (including chat, instant messaging, and even blogs), the most prevalent type is e-mail spam, which costs U. S.  businesses billions of dollars a year in processing expenditures, lost time, and damage caused by malicious software (malware) for which spam can be either a delivery vehicle or an inducement.  In 2007 an estimated 90 billion spam messages were sent each day. The fundamental driving force of spam is the fact that, given one has Internet access, sending e-mail costs essentially nothing, no matter how many messages are sent.  Thus even if only a tiny number of people respond to a spam solicitation (such as for sexual-enhancement products), the result is almost pure profit for the spammer. Besides directly making fraudulent solicitations for products that are ineffective, counterfeit, or nonexistent, spam carries two other dangers: inducements to click to visit fake Web sites , and attachments containing viruses or other dangerous software ,",0
"Ways to stop the spread of spam include the following:, e-mail filtering software, using a combination of text analysis by keyword or statistical correlation , and lists of Internet locations (domains) associated with spamming; filtering can be done both by service providers and individual users, or collaboratively, tightening the technical requirements for messages to be accepted by mail servers (much spam has poorly formatted headers), improving techniques for blocking the viruses used by spammers to set up their bots—see computervirus and firewall, attempting to shut down the infrastructure that supports spam operations, such as hosts who allow e-mail, and sellers of spamming software and illicitly gathered address lists",0
"Spyware and adware are two pervasive threats to computer users.  Both are programs that are installed more or less surreptitiously, often accompanying an attractive-looking “free” software package or media download.  Depending on how widely it is defined, as many as eight out of 10 PCs may be infected by some sort of spyware.  Signs of infection can include the system slowing down or periodically freezing, Web browsers that fail to display the expected home page or search results, and the appearance of numerous unwanted pop-up windows (a sign of adware). Ranging from least to most harmful, spyware and adware can do the following:, Display annoying advertising that can clog up the screen or cover up information (some adware can also be spyware that uses information about the user to target advertising), Track Web browsing to provide information to sell to marketers ,, Obtain personal information for use in identity theft, Install keyloggers (programs that record keystrokes, such as passwords being entered) or other “back door” or “trojan” programs",0
"Growing concern about spyware has prompted the use of antispyware programs such as Ad-Aware and Spybot-Search & Destroy, as well as a free program from Microsoft.  Antispyware programs are also being included in popular security suites from companies such as Symantec and McAfee.  The programs work similarly to antivirus programs, watching for suspicious behavior or “signatures” matching known spyware or adware.  Depending on the program, the spyware can be blocked from executing at all or removed from the system. The software varies considerably in effectiveness, so users may have to run several different programs to completely remove an “infestation. ”Spyware has been generally given a lower priority than viruses or even spam.  When challenged, spyware makers generally claim that the user authorized its installation (at least implicitly) by installing the utility or other software that contains it.  Although antispyware legislation has been introduced in Congress, it has not passed as of mid-2008.  However, state officials such as former New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer successfully sued a spyware company, winning a $7. 5 million settlement",0
"A stack is simply a list that represents successive locations in memory into which data can be inserted.  The operation of a stack can be visualized as being rather like the springloaded platform onto which dishes are stacked for washing in some restaurants.  As each dish (number) is added, the stack is “pushed. ” Because only the item “on top” (the last one added) can be removed (“popped”) at any given time, a stack is described as a LIFO (last in, first out) structure.  (Note that this is different from a queue, where items can be added or removed from either end [see queue]. )Stacks are useful whenever nested items must be tracked.  For example, a procedure might call a procedure that in turn calls another procedure.  The stack can keep track of the parameters (as well as the calling address) for each pending procedure. Stacks can also be used to evaluate nested arithmetic expressions.  ",0
"Web users increasingly have access to such content as news broadcasts, songs, and even full-length videos.  The problem is that the user must receive the content in real time at a steady pace, not in sputters or jerks.  However, factors such as load on the Web server and network congestion between the server and user can cause delays in transmission.  One way to reduce the problem would be to compress the data ,.  However, excessive compression would compromise audio or picture quality to an unacceptable extent.  Fortunately, a technology called streaming offers a way to smooth out the transmission of large amounts audio or video content ,. When a user clicks on an audio or video link, the player software (or Web browser plug-in) is loaded and the transmission begins.  Typically, the player stores a few seconds of the transmission ,, so any momentary delays in the transmission of data packets will not appear as the data starts to play.  Assuming the rate of transmission remains sufficient, enough data remains in the buffer so that data can be “fed” to the playing software at a steady pace.  If, however, there is too much delay due to network congestion, the playback will pause while the player refills its buffer",0

"Supercomputers are always more expensive and somewhat less reliable than standard computers, so they are used only when necessary.  As the power of standard computers continues to grow, applications that formerly required a multimillion-dollar supercomputer can now run on a desktop workstation (a good example is the creation of detailed 3D graphics). On the other hand, there are always applications that will soak up whatever computing power can be brought to bear on them.  These include analysis of new aircraft designs, weather and climate models, the study of nuclear reactions, and the creation of models for the synthesis of proteins.

The system administrator’s responsibilities often include:, setting up accounts for new users, allocating computing resources (such as server space) among users, configuring the file, database, or local area network (LAN) servers, installing new or upgraded software on users’ workstations, keeping up with new versions of the operating system and networking software, using various tools to monitor the performance of the system and to identify potential problems such as device “bottlenecks” or a shortage of disk space, ensuring that regular backups are made, configuring network services such as e-mail, Internet access, and the intranet (local TCP/IP network), using tools such as firewalls and virus scanners to protect the system from viruses, hacker attacks, and other security threats ,, providing user orientation and training, creating and documenting policies and procedures",0
"The systems analyst serves as the bridge between the needs of the user and the capabilities of the computer system.  The systems analyst goes into action when users request that some new application or function be provided (usually in a corporate computing environment). The first step is to define the user’s requirements and to prepare precise specifications for the program.  In doing so, the systems analyst is aided by methodologies developed by computer scientists over the last several decades ,.  Often flowcharts or other aids are used to help visualize the operation of the program ,. After communicating with the user, the systems analyst must then communicate with the programmers, helping them understand what is needed and reviewing their work as they begin to design the program.  Although the systems analyst may do little actual programming, he or she must be familiar with programming tools and practices.  This may make it possible to suggest existing software or components that could be adapted instead of undertaking the cost and time involved with creating a new program.  As a program is developed, systems analysts are often responsible for designing tests to ensure that the software works properly ,",0
"Applications programmers write programs to help users work better, while systems programmers write programs to help the computer itself work better ,.  Systems programmers generally work for companies in the computer industry that develop operating systems, network facilities, program language compilers and other software development tools, utilities, and device drivers.  However, systems programmers can also work for applications developers to help them interface their programs to the operating system or to devices ,. Modern operating systems are highly complex, so systems programmers tend to specialize in particular areas.  These might include device drivers, software development tools, program language libraries, applications programming interfaces (APIs), and utilities for monitoring system conditions and resources.  Systems programmers develop the infrastructure needed for networking, as well as multiple-processor computers and distributed computing systems.  Systems programmers also play a key role when an application program must be “ported” to a different platform or simply modified to run under a new version of the operating system",0
"As the name suggests, a tablet PC is a small computer about the size of a notebook (not to be confused with a “notebook PC,” which is a small, light laptop).  The user can write on the screen with a stylus to take notes (for similar functionality, see graphics tablet), draw, and make selections with stylus or fingertip. If the user writes on the screen, software converts the writing to the appropriate characters and stores them in a file ,.  As with some PDAs, there may also be a system of shorthand “gestures” that can be used to write more quickly.  Alternatively, the user can type with stylus or fingertips on a “virtual keyboard” displayed on the screen ,. A more versatile and natural interface is becoming available: “multitouch,” pioneered by the Apple iPhone and Microsoft Surface, can recognize multiple motions and pressure points simultaneously.  This allows the user to, for example, flick the finger to “turn a page” or use a pinching motion to “pick up” an object. Applications for tablet PCs include many PDA-type applications ,, field note taking, inventory, and other tasks that require a device that is not encumbering.  Because of its compactness, a tablet PC can also be a good reader for ebooks ,. ",0
"An interesting variant is the Internet tablet, best known in Nokia’s N-series.  These are smaller and lighter than a tablet PC.  The Nokia N810, for example, has a slide-out keyboard as well as a virtual screen keyboard.  The most notable feature is the Internet browser and related applications, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and built-in wireless connections ,.  Although there is no phone, Internet-based services such as Skype can be used to place calls, or a Bluetooth-equipped mobile phone.  The Nokia series uses a variant of Linux and can run a large variety of open-source applications",0
"Anyone who has seen computers in old movies is familiar with the row of large, freestanding tape cabinets with their spinning reels of tape.  The visual cue that the computer was running consisted of the reels thrashing back and forth vigorously while rows of lights flashed on the computer console.  Magnetic tape was indeed the mainstay for data storage in most large computers , in the 1950s through the 1970s. In early mainframes the main memory (corresponding to today’s RAM chips) consisted of “core”—thousands of tiny magnetized rings crisscrossed with wires by which they could be set or read.  Because core memory was limited to a few thousand bytes (kB), it was used only to hold the program instructions , and to store temporary working data while the program was running. The source data to be processed by the program was read from a reel of tape on the drive.  If the program updated the data (rather than just reporting on it), it would generally write a new tape with the revised data.  In large facilities a person called a tape librarian was in charge of keeping the reels of tape organized and providing them to the computer operators as needed. ",0
"By the 1990s, PC users generally used tapes only for making backups.  A typical backup tape drive uses DAT (digital audio tape) cartridges that hold from hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes of data.  Most drives use a rotating assembly of four heads (two read and two write) that verify data as it’s being written.  As a backup medium, tape has a lower cost per gigabyte than disk devices.  It is easy to use and can be set up to run unattended (except for periodically changing cartridges). However, since tapes are written and read sequentially, they are not convenient for restoring selected files ,.  Many smaller installations now prefer using a second (“mirror”) hard drive as backup, using disk arrays , or using recordable CDs or optical drives for smaller amounts of data ,. Many large companies and government agencies have thousands of reels of tape stored away in their vaults since the 1960s, including data returned from early NASA space missions.  As time passes, it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that this archived data can be successfully read.  This is due both to gradual deterioration of the medium and the older data formats becoming obsolete ,. ",0
"Tcl includes a number of extensions that, for example, provide access to popular database formats such as MySQL and can interface with other programming languages such as C++ and Java.  The most widely used extension is Tk, which provides a library for creating user interfaces for a variety of operating systems and languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby. Tcl has been described as a “glue” to connect existing applications.  It is relatively easy to write and test a script interactively (often at the command line), and then insert it into the code of an application.  When the application runs, the Tcl interpreter runs the script, whose output can then be used by the main application ,",0
"The header information also includes:, The total length of the packet.  In theory packets can be as large as 65 kbytes; in practice they are limited to a smaller maximum. , An identification number that can be used if a packet is broken into smaller pieces for efficiency in transmission.  This allows the packet to be reassembled at the destination. , A “time to live” value that specifies how many hops (movements from one intermediate host to another) the packet will be allowed to take.  This is reduced by 1 for each hop.  If it reaches 0, the packet is assumed to have gotten “lost” or stale, and is discarded. , A protocol number (the protocol is usually TCP, see below). , A checksum for checking the integrity of the header itself (not the data in the packet). , The source and destination addresses. The source and destination are given as IP addresses, which are 32 bits long and typically written as four sets of up to three numbers each—for example, 208. 162. 106. 17",0
"Most software companies now have Web sites that include a support section that offers services such as, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) files with answers to common problems. , A searchable “knowledge base” of articles relating to various aspects of the software, including compatibility with other products, operating system issues, and so on. , Forms or e-mail links that can be used to submit questions to the company.  Typically questions are answered in one or two working days. , A bulletin board where users can share solutions and tips relating to the software. Web sites for publications such as PC Magazine and ZDNet also offer articles and other resources for working with the various versions of Microsoft Windows and popular applications. ",0
"As millions of people became new computer users during the 1980s, a thriving computer book publishing industry offered users a more user-friendly approach than that usually provided in the manuals issued by the software companies.  The “Dummies” books, offering bite-sized servings of information written in a breezy style and accompanied by cartoons, eventually spread beyond computers into hundreds of other fields and the format was then copied by other publishers.  Publishers such as Sams, Coriolis, and particularly O’Reilly have aimed their offerings at more experienced users, programmers, and multimedia developers. Computer trade books are often written by experienced developers and systems programmers who can offer advanced knowledge and “tips and tricks” to their less experienced colleagues.  Since many technical “gurus” are not experienced writers, the best results often come from collaboration between the expert and an experienced technical writer and/or editor who can review the material for completeness, organization, and clarity. In recent years there has been some contraction in the computer book industry.  This has arisen from several sources: improved on-line help included in products; the dominance of many applications areas by a handful of products; and fewer people needing beginner-level instructions",0
"Many technical writers work within software companies or in the information systems departments of other corporations, universities, or government agencies.  Their work is generally more highly structured than that of the manual or book writer.  As part of a development team, a technical writer may be in charge of creating documentation describing the data structures, classes, and functions within the program.  This task is aided by a variety of tools including facilities for extracting such information automatically from C++ or Java programs.  The writer may also be responsible for maintaining logs that show each change or addition made to the program during each compiled version or “build. ”This type of technical writing requires detailed knowledge of operating systems, programming languages, software development tools, and software engineering methodology.  It also requires the ability to work well as part of a team, often under conditions of high pressure. ",0
"Major policy issues involving information technology industries include:, foreign trade and the protection of intellectual property ,, attempts to reform the patent system to prevent what is seen as dubious and expensive litigation, the need for an increasing number of trained workers and providing a sufficient number of visas for foreign workers ,, preserving equal access to the Internet ,, which pits content providers against telecommunications companies, promoting the development of a next-generation Internet infrastructure (“Internet 2”)government support for computer research (such as through the National Science Foundation)—see government funding of computer research, favorable treatment of online businesses with regard to taxation (often objected to by traditional brickand-mortar businesses)—see e-commerce, laws against computer-related fraud and other crime ,, Privacy regulations ,The computer industry is also involved in issues that will affect its future over the longer term, such as the need to improve math and science education in elementary and high schools, energy and environmental policy, and issues such as health care and pensions that affect all sectors of the economy.

"Prior to the court-ordered breakup of AT&T in 1984, the phone industry functioned in a monolithic way and was not very responsive to the needs of the growing computer networking industry. The breakup of AT&T led to growing competition, providing a wider variety of telecommunications equipment and lower phone rates just as PC users were starting to buy modems and sign up with online services and bulletin boards.  The growing deregulation movement in the 1990s (culminating in the Telecommunications Act of 1996) furthered this process by opening cable and broadcast television, radio, and other wireless communication to competition. With more than half of American Internet users on high-speed connections ,, the delivery of communications and media over the Net can only grow.  Wireless and mobile services (satellite, cell network, and 802. 11—see wireless computing) have also been growing vigorously.  The result is that the “information highway” now has many lanes, with some being express lanes. ",0
"Telecommuting (also called telework) is the ability to work from home or from some location other than the main office.  According to a report by the nonprofit organization WorldatWork, 28. 7 million people worked from home at least one day a month in 2006.  (Self-employed persons, of course, have a much higher rate of working from home. )Telecommuting was made possible by the growing capabilities of home computers and the availability of network connections that allow the worker at home to have access to most of the people and facilities that would be available if the worker were on site.  Workers and companies that promote telecommuting often cite the following advantages:, elimination of stressful, time-wasting commutes, workers may be more productive because they have fewer office distractions, unnecessary meetings, etc. , reduction of traffic, air pollution, and fuel costs, greater flexibility in working hours, the ability of working parents with small children to combine child care and work to some extent, reduction of costs associated with office facilities",0
"Some of the problems or disadvantages cited include:, Worker productivity may decrease due to lack of sufficient discipline and workers becoming distracted at home. ,? Managers may have trouble keeping track of or evaluating the activities of workers who are not physically present. , Telecommuters may miss critical information and go “out of the loop. ”, Security can be compromised, particularly through theft of laptops containing sensitive personal data. , Possible legal liabilities and application of OSHA rules to home working situations.

"The alternative is to connect the remote participant to a mobile robot (this is sometimes called telerobotics).  Such robots already exist, although their capabilities are limited and they are not yet widely used for meetings.  RodneyBrooks, director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, foresees a not very distant future in which such robots will be commonplace. The robot will have considerable built-in capabilities, so the person who has “roboted in” to it won’t need to worry about the mechanics of walking, avoiding obstacles, or focusing vision on particular objects.  Seeing and acting through the robot, the person will be able to move around an environment as freely as persons who are physically present.  The operator can give general commands amounting to “walk over there” or “pick up this object” or perform more delicate manipulations by using his or her hands to manipulate gloves connected to a force-feedback mechanism. Brooks sees numerous applications for robotic telepresence.  For example, someone at work could “robot in” to his or her household robot and do things such as checking to make sure appliances are on or off, respond to a burglar alarm, or even refill the cat’s food dish.  Robotic telepresence could also be used to bring expertise (such as that of a surgeon) to any site around the world without the time and expense of physical travel.  Indeed, robots may be the only way (for the foreseeable future) that humans are likely to explore environments far beyond Earth ,. ",0
"The term template is used in a several contexts in computing, but they all refer to a general pattern that can be customized to create particular products such as documents. In a word processing program such as Microsoft Word, a template (sometimes called a style sheet) is a document that comes with a particular set of styles for various elements such as titles, headings, first and subsequent paragraphs, lists, and so on.  Each style in turn consists of various characteristics such as type font, type style (such as bold), and spacing.  The template also includes properties of the document as a whole, such as margins, header, and footer. To create a new document, the user can select one of several built-in templates for different types of documents such as letters, faxes, and reports, or design a custom template by defining appropriate styles and properties.  Special sequences of programmed actions can also be attached to a template ,. Templates can be created and used for applications other than word processing.  A spreadsheet template consists of appropriate macros and formulas in an otherwise blank spreadsheet.  When it is run, the template prompts the user to enter the appropriate values and then the calculations are performed.  A database program can have input forms that serve in effect as templates for creating new records by inputting the necessary data. ",0
"The primary use of text editors today is to create programs and scripts.  These must generally be created using only standard ASCII characters ,, without all the embedded formatting commands and graphics found in word processing documents.  Programmer’s text editors can be very sophisticated in their own right, providing features such as built in syntax checking and formatting or (as with the Emacs editor) the ability to program the editor itself.  Ultimately, however, program editors must create a source code file that can be processed by the compiler. Text editors are also useful for writing quick, short scripts , and can be handy for writing HTML code for the Web.  However, many Web pages are now designed using word processor–like programs that convert the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) formatting into appropriate HTML codes automatically",0
"Although they use different devices and formats, text messaging on cell phones and PDAs and instant messaging through online services have much in common.  Both involve sending short messages to other users who can receive them and reply as soon as they are online.  (This is an ad hoc connection that differs from a chat room [see chat, online] in that the latter is an established location where people go to converse with other members.  It also differs from an online discussion group [see conferencing systems and netnews and newsgroups] where messages are posted and may be replied to later, but there is no real-time communication. )Text messaging or texting uses a protocol called Short Message Service (SMS), which is available with most cell phones and service plans as well as PDAs that have wireless connections.  When a user sends a message to a designated recipient, it goes to a service center where it is routed to the destination phone; if that phone is not connected, the message is stored and retried later.  Typically messages are limited to 160 characters, though up to six or so messages can be concatenated and treated as a longer message. While texting did not become popular until the late 1990s, instant messaging began in the 1970s as a way for multiple users on a shared computer or network (such as a UNIX system) to communicate in real time using commands such as send and talk (the latter being more conversational—see chat, online).  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, various dial-up services , provided for sending text messages (AOL was the first to use the term instant messages for its facility).  By the mid-1990s instant messaging was well established on the Internet, often employing a graphical user interface, as with ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger (AOL later acquired ICQ as well). ",0
"Between 2000 and 2004 the numbers of text messages sent worldwide soared from 17 billion to 500 billion.  At about a dime a message, texting became a major source of revenue for phone companies.  Since then, texting has continued to grow, particularly in parts of Europe, the Asia-Pacific region (particularly China), and Japan (where it has largely become an Internet-based service). In the United States texting is most popular among teenagers ,.  It is not uncommon to see a bench full of teens talking excitedly to one another while carrying on simultaneous texting with unseen friends in what, to many adult onlookers, appears to be an incomprehensible code, their conversation perhaps ending with ttyl (talk to you later). Loosely affiliated groups communicating by text , have organized everything from “happenings” to serious protest campaigns (as in the anti-WTO [World Trade Organization] demonstrations in Seattle in 1999 and in the Philippines uprising in 2001. )",0
"As the name implies, a touchscreen is a screen display that can respond to various areas being touched or pressed.  Invented in 1971, the first form of touchscreens to become part of daily life were found on automatic teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale credit card processors. Touchscreens can detect the pressure of a finger or stylus in several ways: A “resistive” touchscreen uses two layers of electrically conductive metallic material separated by a space.  When an area is touched, the two layers are electrically connected, and the change in electrical current is registered and converted to a code that identifies the location touched.  Surface acoustic wave (SAW) touchscreens use an ultrasonic wave that is interrupted by a touch; capacitive touchscreens respond to the change in electron storage (capacitance) caused by contact with a human body.  Various other acoustic, mechanical (strain-based), or optical systems can also be used, with the latter being particularly popular",0
"Many computer applications involve the arrival of a set of data that must be processed in a specified way.  For example, a bank’s ATM system receives a customer’s request to deposit money together with identification of the account and the amount to be deposited.  The system must accept the deposit, update the account balance, and return a receipt to the customer.  This is an example of real-time transaction processing. Some applications process transactions in batches.  For example, a company may run a program once a month that generates paychecks and withholding stubs from employee records that include hours worked, number of dependents claimed, and so on.  Indeed, in the ATM example, the account balance is typically not updated during the on-line transaction, but instead a batch transaction is stored.  Overnight that transaction will be processed together with other transactions affecting that account (such as checks), and the balance will then be officially updated.  (The program module that keeps track of the progress of transactions is called a transaction monitor. )",0
"The tree is a data structure that consists of individual intersections called nodes.  The tree normally starts with a single root node.  (Unlike real trees, data trees have their root at the top and branch downward. ) The root connects to one or more nodes, which in turn branch into additional nodes, often through a number of levels.  (A node that branches downward from another node is called that node’s childnode. ) A node at the bottom that does not branch any further is called a terminal node or sometimes a leaf. Trees are useful for expressing many sorts of hierarchical structures such as file systems where the root of a disk holds folders that in turn can hold files or additional folders, and so on down many levels.  (A corporate organization chart is a noncomputer example of a hierarchical tree. )",0
"A binary tree is a tree in which no node has more than two child nodes.  To move through data stored in a binary tree, a program can use two pointers, one to the current node’s left child and one to its right child ,.  The pointers can then be used to trace the paths through the nodes.  If the tree represents a file that has been sorted ,, comparing nodes to the desired value and branching accordingly quickly leads to the desired record. Alternatively, the data can be stored directly in contiguous memory locations corresponding to the successive numbers of the nodes.  This method is faster than having to trace through successive pointers, and a binary search algorithm can be applied directly to the stored data.  On the other hand it is easier to insert new items into a linked list ,. A common solution is to combine the two structures, storing the linked list in a contiguous range of memory by storing its root in the middle of the range, its left child at the beginning of the range, its right child at the end, and then repeatedly splitting each portion of the range to store each level of children.  Intuitively, one can see that algorithms for processing such stored trees will take a recursive approach ,",0
"The more than five-century-old art of typography (the design, arrangement, and setting of printing type) was transformed in the latter part of the 20th century by digital technology.  With the exception of some traditional presses devoted to the fine book market, nearly all type used today is designed and set by computer. Most users are familiar with the typefaces distributed with their operating system and software, such as the popular Adobe and TrueType ,.  Many such font designs are based on (and sometimes named after) traditional typefaces, modified for readability using typical displays and printers. For control of composition, there are three overlapping levels of software, ranging from easiest to use (but most limited) to most complex, versatile, and precise.  Modern word processors such as Microsoft Word and Open Office provide enough control for many types of shorter documents ,.  Desktop publishing software adds facilities suitable for layout of fliers, brochures, newsletters, and similar publications that often mix text and graphics ,. More elaborate documents such as books, magazines, and newspapers require more sophisticated facilities to control the layout and flow of text.  Some traditional choices include LaTex (for the Tex typesetting program), used particularly by scientists and other academics, and the older troff and its offshoots on UNIX systems.  More recent programs include Quark, FrameMaker, PageMaker, and InDesign.  Related utilities often used in digital typography include font editors (for design and modification) and utilities to convert fonts from one format to another",0
"Ubiquitous (or pervasive) computing focuses not on individual computers and tasks but on a world where most objects (including furniture and appliances) have the ability to communicate information.  (This has also been called “the Internet of things. ”) This can be viewed as the third phase in a process where the emphasis has gradually shifted from individual desktops (1980s) to the network and Internet (1990s) to mobile presence and the ambient environmentSome examples of ubiquitous computing might include:, picture frames that display pictures attuned to the user’s activities, “dashboard” devices that can be set to display changing information such as weather and stock quotes, parking meters that can provide verbal directions to nearby attractions, kiosks or other facilities to provide verbal cues to guide travelers, such as through airports, home monitoring systems that can sense and deal with accidents or health emergencies",0
"The essential core of the UNIX system is the kernel, which provides facilities to organize and access files ,, move data to and from devices, and control the running of programs (processes).  In designing UNIX, Thompson deliberately kept the kernel small, noting that he wanted maximum flexibility for users.  Since the kernel was the only part of the system that could not be reconfigured or replaced by the user, he limited it to those functions that reliability and efficiency dictated be handled at the system level. Another way in which the UNIX kernel was kept simple was through device independence.  This meant that instead of including specific instructions for operating particular models of terminal, printers, or plotters within the kernel, generic facilities were provided.  These could then be interfaced with device drivers and configuration files to control the particular devices. A UNIX system typically has many users, each of whom may be running a number of programs.  The interface that processes user commands is called the shell.  It is important to note that in UNIX a shell is just another program, so there can be (and are) many different shells reflecting varying tastes and purposes ,.  Traditional UNIXshells include the Bourne shell (sh), C shell (csh), and Korn shell (ksh).  Modern UNIX systems can also have graphical user interfaces similar to those found on Windows and Macintosh personal computers ,. ",0
"Traditional print and broadcast media divide the world into two groups: content producers and content consumers.  However, as noted by its creator Tim Berners-Lee at its very beginning, the World Wide Web had at least the potential for users to take an active role in linking existing content and contributing their own ,.  Indeed, Berners-Lee wanted Web client software to include not only browsing functions but easy ways for users to create their own Web pages. In reality, early users faced something of a learning curve, usually having to cope with HTML to some extent, for example.  But by the mid-2000s a variety of new media of communication had become readily accessible using an ordinary Web browser at sites that host the required software.  The most prominent applications are blogs , and wikis, particularly Wikipedia ,. Meanwhile, inexpensive digital still and video cameras and easy-to-use editing software encouraged people to make their own media creations.  Sites to enable users to upload, share, and comment on their creations have flourished ,. The growth of sites such as Facebook and MySpace , has also provided new ways for users from junior high school age on up to create and share content",0
"The marketplace has spoken, and the desktop GUI is now the mainstream interface for most ordinary PC users.  However, there are a variety of other interfaces that are used for particular circumstances or applications, such as:, touchscreens (as with ATMs) ,, handwriting or written “gesture” recognition, such as on handheld computers , or for drawing tablets, voice-controlled systems ,, trackballs, joysticks, and touchpads (used as mouse alternatives), virtual reality interfaces using head-mounted systems, sensor gloves, and so on ,Because much interaction with computers is now away from the desktop and taking place on laptops, handheld, or palm computers, and even in cars, there is likely to be continuing experimentation with user interface design.

"Dating back to the mid-1990s, VBScript is a scripting language developed by Microsoft and based on its popular Visual Basic programming language ,.  It is also part of the evolution of what Microsoft called “active scripting,” based on components that allow outside access to the capabilities of applications.  The host environment in which scripts run is provided through Windows (as with Windows Script Host) or within Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser. For client-side processing, VBScript can be used to write scripts embedded in HTML pages, which interact with the standard Document Object Model , in a way similar to other Web scripting languages (in particular, see JavaScript).  However, VBScript is not supported by popular non-Microsoft browsers such as Firefox and Opera, so developers generally must use the widely compatible JavaScript instead.  VBScript can also be used for processing on the Web server, particularly in connection with Microsoft’s Web servers ,. Because versions of Windows starting with Windows 98 include Windows Script Host, VBScripts can also be written to run directly under Windows.  One unfortunate consequence was scripts containing worms (such as the I LOVE YOU worm) or other malware and mailed as attachments to unwary use",0
"When videotape first became available in the 1950s, recorders cost thousands of dollars and could only be afforded by TV studios.  Today the VCR is inexpensive and ubiquitous.  However, it is hard to edit videotape.  Tape is a linear medium, meaning that to find a given piece of video the tape has to be moved to that spot.  Removing or adding something involves either physically splicing the tape (as is done with film) or more commonly, feeding in tape from two or more recorders onto a destination tape.  Besides being tedious and limited in capabilities, “linear editing” by copying loses a bit of quality with each copying operation. Today, however, it is easy to shoot video in digital form , or to convert analog video into digital form.  Digital video is a stream of data that represents sampling of the source signal, such as from the chargecoupled device (CCD) that turns light photons into electron flow in a digital camera or digital camcorder.  This process involves either software or hardware compression for storage and decompression for viewing and editing (such a scheme is called a CODEC for “compression/decompression”).  The most widely used formats include DV (Digital Video) and MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group), which has versions that vary in the amount of compression and thus fidelity",0
" A little later, bulletin boards and especially systems such as the WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link) based in the San Francisco Bay Area , provided long-term outlets for people to share information and interact on-line. Looking at the WELL, a writer named Howard Rheingold introduced the term virtual community in a 1993 book.  He explored the ways in which a sufficiently compelling and versatile technology encouraged people to form long-term contacts, form personal relationships, and carry out feuds.  When on-line, participants experience such a venue as the WELL as a place that becomes almost as tangible (and often as “real”) as a physical place such as a small town or corner bar. Virtual community members who live in the same geographical area sometimes do get together physically (the WELL has had picniclike “WELL Office Parties” for many years).  Members can band together to support a colleague who faces a crisis such as the life-threatening illness of a son (on the WELL, blank postings called beams are often used as an expression of sympathy).  The virtual community can also serve as a rallying point following a physical disaster such as the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.  On a daily basis, virtual communities can often provide help or advice from a remarkable variety of highly qualified experts. ",0
" the computing field, virtualization involves the creation of a working model or representation of one system within a different system.  This idea has been widely used in the field since the 1960s.  Some applications of virtualization include:, An appropriate model of a system (such as a programming framework—see application programming interface) that hides unneeded details can make it easier for programmers to understand and access its functions ,. , A compiler for a language that compiles all programs to an intermediate representation (such as “bytecode”).  A virtual machine running on each kind of platform can then run the code, taking care of the details required by the host hardware ,. , A virtual machine created in software can be designed to perform all the functions available on a particular hardware platform or operating system, allowing software to be run on a system different from the one for which it was originally written ,.  For example, there are a number of virtualization programs (such as VMWare for PCs) that can create separate areas in memory, each running a different operating system, such as a version of Windows or Linux. ,? Multiple processors or entire computers can be treated as a single entity for processing a program, with software designed to assign threads of execution to physical processors and to coordinate the use of shared data ,. , A physical device such as a disk drive can be made to appear as several separate devices to the operating system (for better organization of data).  Similarly, many servers can run on the same physical machine.  Conversely, multiple drives can appear to be a single logical device while providing redundancy and error recovery ,. , A secure “virtual private network” can be created within the larger public Internet.  The virtual system takes care of encrypting and transmitting data through the physical network. ",0
"The concept of virtualization can also be applied to how work involving computers is being conceptualized and organized in the modern world ,.  A “virtual office” or even “virtual corporation” is a business entity that is not tied to a physical location, but uses networks, communications technology, and facilities such as video conferencing to keep workers in touch.  Alternatively, several organizations can share the same physical space (such as for mail or shipping) while maintaining their separate identities. Similarly, people can form long-lasting social networks while meeting physically seldom (if at all)—see socialnetworking and virtual community",0
"Besides military training, currently the most viable application for VR seems to be entertainment.  VR techniques have been used to create immersive experiences in elaborate facilities at venues such as Disneyland and Universal Studios, and to some extent even in local arcades.  VR that is accompanied by convincing physical sensations has allowed for the creation of a new generation of roller coasters that if built physically would be too expensive, too dangerous, or even physically impossible. However, there are other significant emerging applications for VR.  When combined with telerobotic technology ,, VR techniques are already being used to allow surgeons to perform operations in new ways.  VR technology can also be used to make remote conferencing more realistic and satisfactory for participants.  Clearly the potential uses for VR for education and training in many different fields are endless.  VR technology combined with robotics could also be used to give disabled persons much greater ability to carry out the tasks of daily life. In the ultimate VR system, users will be networked and able to simultaneously experience the environment, interacting both with it and one another.  The technical resources and programming challenges are also much greater for such applications.  The result, however, might well be the sort of environment depicted by science fiction writers such as William Gibson ,",0
"The basic idea of VoIP is simple: the Internet can carry packets of any sort of data ,, which means it can carry the digitized human voice as well, carrying ordinary phone calls.  There are several ways to do this:, a regular phone plus an adapter that connects to the computer and compresses and converts between regular analog phone signals and the digital equivalent, a complete “IP phone” unit that includes all needed hardware and software—no computer needed, just a network connection, such as to a router, use of the computer’s own sound card and speakers with a microphone, plus software (often free)Using that last option, VoIP service can be essentially free, regardless of distance.  However, one can only call someone who is currently connected to the Internet and also has VoIP software",0
"At least as currently implemented, VoIP does have some disadvantages:, Like cordless phones (but unlike traditional phones), VoIP requires that the user be connected to power.  This may make the system unavailable in an emergency. , Also, in an emergency, a 911 operator has no way to know where the caller is located geographically.  This could be a problem if the caller is unable to provide this information. , While a regular phone is a pretty simple device, VoIP requires special hardware or a PC, which might fail. , VoIP requires a working Internet connection—in practice, a high-speed connection ,.  Load or instability in the network could cause interruptions in calls or a lowering of voice quality. , As with other data sent over the Internet, there are potential security concerns.  Encryption can be used to secure VoIP calls, but this in turn leads to concerns by law enforcement agencies seeking to implement eavesdropping warrants. ",0
"For some time, technology pundits have talked about computers being literally woven into daily life, embedded in clothing and personal accessories.  However, implementations have thus far seen only limited use.

(People have also walked about with attached webcams, although the novelty seems to have quickly worn off. )",0
"Although the most important part of Web 2. 0 is its business and social models, a number of Web technologies are needed to provide the flexibility and rich interaction needed to offer a new Web experience.

"Some typical features of a modern Web browser include, navigation buttons to move forward and back through recently visited pages, tabs to switch between Web pages, a “history” panel allowing return to pages visited in recent days, a search button that brings up the default search engine (which can be chosen by the user), the ability to save page as “favorites” or “bookmarks” for easy retrieval",0
"Today a Web user can view a live news broadcast, listen to music from a radio station, or view a document formatted to near-print quality.  All these activities are made possible by “helper” software , that gives the Web browser the capability to load and display or play files in special formats.  Examples include the Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) reader, the Windows Media Player, and RealPlayer for playing video and audio content ,. What makes the browser even more versatile is the ability to load and run programs from Web sites ,.

"Thousands of real-time views of the world are available on the Web.  These include everything from the prosaic (a coffee machine at MIT) to the international (a view of downtown Paris or Tokyo) to the sublime (a Rocky Mountain sunset).  All of these views are made possible thanks to the availability of inexpensive digital cameras ,. To create a basic webcam, the user connects a digital camera to a PC, usually via a USB cable.  A program controls the camera, taking a picture at frequent intervals (perhaps every 30 seconds or minute).  The picture is received from the camera as a JPG (JPEG) file.  The program then uploads the picture to the user’s Web page (usually using file transfer protocol, or ftp), replacing the previous picture.  Users connected to the Web site can click to see the latest picture.  Alternatively, a script running on the server can update the picture automatically. ",0
"The Web filter examines requests made by a Web user , and blocks those associated with sites deemed by the filter user to be objectionable.  There are two basic mechanisms for determining whether a site is unsuitable.  The first is to check the site’s address (URL) against a list and reject a request for any site on the list.  (Most filter programs come with default lists; the filter user can add other sites as desired.  Generally, the filter is installed with a password so only the authorized user [such as a parent] can change the filter’s behavior. )The other filtering method relies on a list of keywords associated with objectionable activities (such as pornography).  When the user requests a site, the filter checks the page for words on the keyword list.  If a matching word or phrase is found, the site is blocked and not shown to the user. ",0
"There are many online services (including some free ones) that will provide users with personal Web pages.

"When a user types in (or clicks on) a link in the browser window, the browser sends a HTTP request ,.  To construct the request, the browser first looks at the address (URL) in the user request.  An address such as http://www. well. com/conferencing. html consists of three parts In order to direct the browser’s request to the appropriate host and server, the browser sends the URL to a name server ,.  The name server provides the appropriate numeric IP address ,.  The browser then sends an HTTP “get” request to the server’s IP address. Assuming the page requested is valid, the server sends the HTML file to the browser.  The browser in turn interprets the formatting and display instructions in the HTML file and “renders” the text and graphics appropriately.  It is remarkable that this whole process from user click to displayed page usually takes only a few seconds, even if the Web site is thousands of miles away and requests must be relayed through many intervening computers",0
"There are several ways in which Web services can be accessed:, Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which generally uses WSDL and follows a format similar to the traditional way programs call upon library functions, An organization based on the available messages rather than calls or operations ,, Representational State Transfer (REST), which views applications or services as collections of “resources” with specific addresses (URLs) and specific requests using HTTPA variety of other specifications and approaches can be used; this area is a very fluid one.

"Typically, a wireless LAN uses a frequency band with each unit on a slightly different frequency, thus allowing all units to communicate without interference.  (Although radio frequency is now most popular, wireless LANs can also use microwave links, which are sometimes used as an alternative to Ethernet cable in large facilities. )Usually there is a network access point, a PC that contains a transceiver and serves as the network hub (it may also serve as a bridge between the wireless network and a wired LAN).  The hub computer can also be connected to a high-speed Internet service via DSL or cable.  It has an antenna allowing it to communicate with wireless PCs up to several hundred feet away, depending on building configuration. Each computer on the wireless network has an adapter with a transceiver so it can communicate with the access point.  The adapter can be built-in (as is the case with some handheld computers), or mounted on a PC card (for laptops) or an ISA card (for desktop PCs) or connected to a USB port. ",0
"The term word processor was actually coined by IBMin the 1960s to refer to a system consisting of a Selectric typewriter with magnetic tape storage.  This allowed the typist to record keystrokes (and some data such as margin settings) on tape.  Material could be corrected by being rerecorded.  The tape could then be used to print as many perfect copies of the document as required.  A version using magnetic cards instead of tape appeared in 1969. The first modern-style word processor was marketed by Lexitron and Linolex.  It also used magnetic tape, but it added a video display screen.  Now the writer could see and correct text without having to print it first.  A few years later, a new invention, the floppy disk, became the standard storage medium for dedicated word processing systems. The word-processing systems developed by Wang, Digital Equipment Corporation, Data General, and others became a feature in large offices in the late 1970s.  These systems were essentially minicomputers with screens, keyboards, and printers and running a specialized software program.  Because these systems were expensive (ranging from about $8,000 to $20,000 or more), they were not affordable by smaller businesses.  Typically, they were operated by specially trained personnel (who became known also as “word processors”) to whom documents were funneled for processing, as with the old “typing poo",0

"NLP is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguis-tics and computer science, particularly artificial intelligence ,.  In terms of linguistics, a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple mean-ings (“wind up the clock” and “the wind is cold today”) as well as grammatical ambiguities (in the phrase “little girl’s school” is it the school that is little, the girls, or both?).  Of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity. Programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems, including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a “corpus” of existing text in that language ,. As formidable as the task of extracting the correct (lit-eral) meaning from text can be, it is really only the first level of natural language processing.  If a program is to success-fully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from North Korea, for example, it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and/or a set of “frames” , about how to interpret vari-ous situations such as threat, bluff, or compromise. )",0
"Users of modern operating systems such as microsoft Win-dows are familiar with multitasking, or running several programs at the same time.  For example, a user might be writing a document in a word processor, pause to check the e-mail program for incoming messages, type a page address int o a Web browser, then return to writing.  meanwhile, the operating system may be running a number of other pro-grams tucked unobtrusively into the background, such as a virus checker, task scheduler, or system resource monitor. Each running program “takes turns” using the PC’s cen-tral processor.  In early versions of Windows, multitasking was cooperative, with each program expected to periodically yield the processor to Windows so it could be assigned to the next program in the queue.  One weakness of this approach is that if a program crashes, the CPU might be “locked up” and the system would have to be rebooted.  However, Win-dows NT, 2000, and xP (as well as operating systems such as UNIx) use preemptive multitasking.  The operating sys-tem assigns a “slice” of processing (CPU) time to a program and then switches it to the next program regardless of what might be happening to the previous program.  Thus, if a pro-gram  “crashes,”  the  CPU  will  still  be  switched  to  the  next program,  and  the  user  can  maintain  control  of  the  system and shut down the offending program. ",0

"Whatever memory chips or other devices are installed in a computer,  the  operating  system  and  application  programs must  have  a  way  to  allocate,  use,  and  eventually  release portions of memory.  The goal of memory management is to use available memory most efficiently.  This can be difficult in  modern  operating  environments  where  dozens  of  pro-grams may be competing for memory resources. Early  computers  were  generally  able  to  run  only  one program at a time.  These machines didn’t have a true oper-ating  system,  just  a  small  loader  program  that  loaded  the application  program,  which  essentially  took  over  control of the machine and accessed and manipulated the memory.

"A list is a series of data items that can be accessed sequen-tially  by  following  links  from  one  item  to  the  next.   Lists can be very useful for ordering or sorting data items and for storing them on a stack or queue. There  are  two  general  approaches  to  constructing  lists.  In a data list used with procedural programming languages such  as  C,  each  list  item  consists  of  a  structure  consisting of a data member and a pointer.  The pointer, called “next,” contains the address of the next item.  A program can easily “step through” a list by starting with the first item, process-ing  its  data,  then  using  the  pointer  to  move  to  the  next item,  continuing  until  some  condition  is  met  or  the  end  of the list is reached.

A LISP-style node list can be even  more  flexible  in  that  items  with  varying  sizes  and types of data can be included in the same list.  Lists are thus a  more  flexible  way  to  implement  such  things  as  look-up tables. ",0
"Linux  is  an  increasingly  popular  alternative  to  proprietary operating systems.  Its development sprang from two sources.

"JavaScript  is  one  of  several  popular  languages  that  can enable  Web  pages  to  interact  with  users  more  quickly  and efficiently ,.  The  language  first  appeared  in  the  mid-1990s’  Netscape  2 browser under the name LiveScript.  Technically, JavaScript is  the  Sun microsystems  trademark  for  its  implementation of  a  standard  called  ECmAScript.   Despite  the  name,  Java-Script  is  not  directly  related  to  the  Java  programming  lan-guage. In  its  early  years  JavaScript  was  perhaps  a  victim  of  its own  success.   Having  a  relatively  easy-to-use  scripting  lan-guage  provided  an  easier  way  to  add  features  such  as  3D buttons  and  pop-up  windows  to  formerly  humdrum  Web forms.   However,  as  with  an  earlier  generation’s  fondness for multiple fonts, early JavaScript programmers were often prone  to  add  unnecessary  and  confusing  clutter  to  Web pages.   Besides  sometimes  annoying  users,  early  JavaScript also  suffered  from  significant  differences  in  how  it  was implemented  by  the  major  browsers.   As  a  result,  Netscape users  were  sometimes  stymied  by  JavaScript  written  for micr  osoft Internet Explorer, and vice versa.  Finally, browser flaws have sometimes allowed JavaScript to be used to com-promise  security  such  as  by  installing  malware-infested “browser helpers. ” As a result, many security experts began to  recommend  that  users  disable  JavaScript  execution  in their browsers.

"Java  has  largely  fulfilled  this  promise  for  Web  developers.  C++  programmers  have  an  easy  learning  curve  to  Java, since  the  two  languages  have  very  similar  syntax  and  a similar use of classes and other object-oriented features.  On the  other  hand,  programmers  who  don’t  know  C++  benefit from  Java  being  more  streamlined  than  C++.   For  example, Java avoids the necessity to use pointers ,  and  uses  classes  as  the  consistent  building block of program structure.  Software powerhouses such as microsoft (until recently) and IBm have joined Sun in pro-moting Java. Another  much-touted  feature  of  Java  is  its  platform independence.  The language itself is separate from the vari-ous  operating  system  platforms.   For  each  platform,  a  Java Vir tual machine ( JVm) is created, which interprets or com-piles the code generated by the Java compiler so it can run on that platform. For  security,  Java  applets  run  within  a  “sandbox”  or restricted  environment  so  the  user  is  protected  from  mali-cious   Java   programs.    (For   example,   programs   are   not allowed  to  access  the  user’s  disk  or  to  connect  the  user’s machine to another Web site. ) Web browsers can also be set to disable the running of Java applets.

"An interpreter is a program that analyzes (parses) program-ming commands or statements in a high-level language ,,  creates  equivalent  executable instructions in machine code , and executes them.  An interpreter differs from a compiler in that the lat-ter converts the entire program to an executable file rather than processing and executing it a statement at a time . many  earlier  versions  of  the  BASIC  programming  lan-guage  were  implemented  as  interpreters.   Since  an  inter-preter only has to hold one program statement at a time in memory, it could run on early microcomputers that had only a  few  tens  of  thousands  of  bytes  of  system  memory.   How-ever,  interpreters  run  programs  considerably  more  slowly than a compiled program would run.  One reason is that an interpreter “throws away” each source code statement after it  interprets  it.   This  means  that  if  a  statement  runs  repeat-edly ,, it must be re-interpreted each time it runs.  A  compiler,  on  the  other  hand,  would  create  only  one  set of  machine  code  instructions  for  the  loop  and  then  move on.

"By  the  mid-2000  decade,  the  biggest  intellectual  property battles  were  not  about  esoteric  program  codes  but  rather revolved around how to satisfy the ordinary home consum-er’s  appetite  for  music  and  video  while  preserving  produc-ers’  revenues.   Increasingly,  music  and  even  video  is  being downloaded rather than being bought in commercial pack-aging at the local store. In  the Sony  v.

"While  much  attention  is  paid  by  system  designers  to  the representation, storage and manipulation of information in the computer, the ultimate value of information processing software is determined by how well it provides for the effec-tive retrieval of that information.

"Image  processing  is  a  general  term  for  the  manipulation of  a  digitized  image  to  produce  an  enhanced  or  more  con-venient  version.   Some  of  the  earliest  applications  were  in the military (aerial and, later, satellite reconnaissance) and in  the  space  program.   The  military  and  space  programs had a great need for extracting as much useful information as  possible  from  images  that  were  often  gathered  under extreme or marginal conditions.  They also needed to make cameras  and  other  hardware  components  simultaneously more  compact  and  more  efficient,  and  generally  had  the funds to pay for such specialized developments. Once  developed,  higher-quality  image  processing  sys-tems found their way into other applications such as domes-tic  surveillance  and  medical  imaging.   The  development  of cameras that could directly turn light into digitized images , made image processing seam-less by avoiding the necessity of scanning images from tra-ditional film. Image  processing  applications  can  be  divided  into three general categories: enhancement, interpretation, and maintenance. ",0

"The base 16 or hexadecimal system is a natural way to rep-resent the binary data stored in a computer.  It is more com-pact than binary because four binary digits can be replaced by a single “hex” digit. The  following  table  gives  the  corresponding  decimal, binary, and hex values from 0 to 15:Note that decimal and hex digits are the same from 0 to 9,  but  hex  uses  the  letters  A–F  to  represent  the  digits  cor-responding to decimal 10–15.  The system extends to higher numbers  using  increasing  powers  of  16,  just  as  decimal uses  powers  of  10:  For  example,  hex  FF  represents  binary 111  11111 or decimal 255.  many of the apparently arbitrary numbers encountered in programming can be better under-stood  if  one  realizes  that  they  correspond  to  convenient groupings of bits: FF is eight bits, sufficient to hold a single character ,.

"In  operating  systems  and  certain  programming  languages (such as LISP), a heap is a pool of memory resources avail-able  for  allocation  by  programs.

If  the  same  size,  they  are  linked  together  by  pointers ,.    memory is then allocated for a vari-able by traversing the list and setting the required number of  cells  to  be  “owned”  by  that  variable.

"In  the  early  days  of  computing,  the  programmers  of  a  sys-tem  tended  to  also  be  its  users  and  were  thus  intimately familiar  with  the  program’s  operation  and  command  set.  To search a hashed database, the hashing formula is first applied to the search key, yielding a hash value.  That value can then be used in a binary search to quickly zero in on the matching record, if any.         health, personalIf not a programmer, the user of a mainframe program was probably  at  least  a  well-trained  operator  who  could  work with  the  aid  of  a  brief  summary  or  notes  provided  by  the programmer.   However,  with  the  beginnings  of  office  auto-mation  in  the  1970s  and  the  growing  use  of  desktop  com-puters in office, home, and school in the 1980s, increasingly complex  programs  were  being  put  in  the  hands  of  users who  often  had  only  minimal  computer  training  ,. While  programs  often  came  with  one  or  more  tutorial or  reference  manuals,  designers  realized  that  offering  help through  the  program  itself  would  have  some  clear  advan-tages.  First, the user would not have to switch attention from the computer screen to look things up in a manual.  Second, the  help  system  could  be  programmed  to  not  only  provide information,  but  also  to  help  the  user  find  the  informa-tion needed in a given situation.  For example, related topics could be linked together and a searchable index provided",0
"A hash  is  a  numeric  value  generated  by  applying  a  math-ematical  formula  to  the  numeric  values  of  the  characters in a string of text ,.  The for-mula is chosen so that the values it produces are always the same  length  (regardless  of  the  length  of  the  original  text) and  are  very  likely  to  be  unique.   (Two  different  strings should  not  produce  the  same  hash  value.   Such  an  event  is called a collision. )",0
"The  two  major  application  areas  for  hashing  are  informa-tion  retrieval  and  cryptographic  certification.   In  databases, an index table can be built that contains the hash values for the key fields and the corresponding record number for each field,  with  the  entries  in  hash  value  order.   To  search  the database, an input key is hashed and the value is compared with  the  index  table  (which  can  be  done  using  a  very  fast binary search).  If the hash value is found, the corresponding record number is used to look up the record.  This tends to be much faster than searching an index file directly. ",0
"Even  after  decades  of  evolution  in  computing,  the  hard disk  drive  remains  the  primary  means  of  fast  data  storage and  retrieval  in  computer  systems  of  all  sizes.   The  disk itself consists of a rigid aluminum alloy platter coated with a  magnetic  oxide  material.   The  platter  can  be  rotated  at speeds of more than 10,000 rpm.  A typical drive consists of a stack of such platters mounted on a rotating spindle, with a read/write head mounted above each platter. Early  hard  drive  heads  were  controlled  by  a  stepper motor, which positioned the head in response to a series of electrical pulses.  (This system is still used for floppy drives. ) Today’s hard drives, however, are controlled by a voice-coil actuator,  similar  in  structure  to  an  audio  speaker.   The  coil surrounds a magnet.  When a current enters the coil, it gen-erates a magnetic field that interacts with that of the perma-nent magnet, moving the coil and thus the disk head.  Unlike the stepper motor, the voice coil is continuously variable and its  greater  precision  allows  data  tracks  to  be  packed  more tightly on the platter surface, increasing disk capacity. The  storage  capacity  of  a  drive  is  determined  by  the number  of  platters  and  the  spacing  (and  thus  number)  of tracks  that  can  be  laid  down  on  each  platter.   Capacities have  steadily  increased  while  prices  have  plummeted:  In 1980,  for  example,  a  hard  drive  for  an  Apple  II  microcom-put  er cost more than $1,000 and held only 5 mB of data.

If the user is allowed  to  use  normal  strokes,  the  system  must  be  gradu-ally  “trained”  by  the  user  giving  writing  samples  and  con-firming the system’s guess about the letters.

"google  Inc.   (NASDAQ  symbol: gOOg)  has  built  a  busi-ness  colossus  by  focusing  on  helping  users  find  what  they are  looking  for  on  the  Internet  while  selling  advertising targeted at those same users.  By 2006, “to google” could be found in dictionaries as a verb meaning to look up anyone or anything online. goog  le was founded by two Stanford students ,  who,  for  their  doctoral  thesis, had described a Web search algorithm that could give a bet-ter  idea  of  the  likely  relevance  of  a  given  site  based  on  the number  of  sites  that  linked  to  it.   The  two  students  imple-mented  a  search  engine  based  on  their  ideas  and  hosted  it on  the  Stanford  Web  site,  where  its  popularity  soon  irri-tated  the  university’s  system  administrators.   In  1998  their bus  iness  was  incorporated  as google,  Inc. ,  and  moved  to the  archetypal  Silicon  Valley  entrepreneur’s  location—a friend’s  garage.   However,  as  the  company  attracted  invest-ment  capital  and  grew  rapidly,  it  moved  to  Palo  Alto  and the  n its present home in mountain View. google’s  initial  public  stock  offering  was  in  2004,  and the   market’s   enthusiastic   response   made   many   senior employees  instant  millionaires.  google’s  steady  growth  in subsequent  years  has  kept  its  stock  in  demand,  reaching  a record  peak  of  $560  in  September  2007.

"prior  to  the  late  1970s,  most  computer  applications  (other than  some  scientific  and  experimental  ones)  did  not  use graphics.   However,  the  early  microcomputer  systems  such as the Apple II, Radio Shack TRS-80, and Commodore PET could all display graphics, either on a monitor or (with the aid  of  a  video  modulator)  on  an  ordinary  TV  set.   While primitive (low resolution; monochrome or just a handful of colors)  this  graphics  capability  allowed  for  a  thriving  mar-ket in games and educational software. The  earliest  video  displays  for  mainstream  PCs  pro-vid ed basic text display capabilities (such as the mDA, or monochrome  display  adapter,  with  25  lines  of  text  up  to 80  characters  per  line)  plus  the  ability  to  create  graphics by setting the color of individual pixels.  The typical low-endgraphics card of the early 1980s was the CgA (Color graphics  Adapter),  which  offered  various  modes  such  as 320  by  200  pixels  with  four  colors.   Computers  marketed forprofessional  use  offered  the  EgA  (Enhanced graph-ics  Adapter),  which  could  show  640  by  350  pixels  at  16 colors. ",0
"Broadly speaking, a graphics file consists of data that speci-fies the color of each pixel (dot) in an image.  Since there are many  ways  this  information  can  be  organized,  there  are  a variety  of  graphics  file  formats.  ",0
"In  a  bitmap  format  there  is  a  group  of  bits  (i. e.   a  binary value)  that  specifies  the  color  of  each  pixel.   Windows  pro-vides standard  bitmap  (BmP)  formats  for  1-bit  (2  colors or  monochrome),  4-bit  (16  colors),  8-bit  (256  colors),  or 24-bit  (16  million  colors).   The  Windows  bitmap  format  is also  called  a  DIB  (device-independent  bitmap)  because  the stored  colors  are  independent  of  the  output  device  to  be used  (such  as  a  monitor  or  printer).   The  relevant  device driver is responsible for translating the color to one actually used by the device.  Because it is “native” to Windows, BmP is widely used, especially for program graphics resources. ",0
"Bitmap  formats  have  the  advantage  of  storing  the  exact color  of  every  pixel  without  losing  any  information.   How-ever,  this  means  that  the  files  can  be  very  large  (from hundreds  of  thousands  of  bytes  to  several  megabytes  for Windows  screen  graphics).   BmP  and  other  bitmap  formats do  support  a  simple  method  of  compression  called  run-length encoding (RLE), where a series of identical pixels is replaced  by  a  single  pixel  and  a  count.   Bitmap  files  can  be further compressed through the use of utilities such as the popular Zip program ",0
"EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is a vector-based rather than bitmap (raster) format.  This means that an EPS file consists not  of  the  actual  pixel  values  of  an  image,  but  the  instruc-tions for drawing the image (including coordinates, colors, and  so  on).   The  instructions  are  specified  as  a  text  file  in the versatile PostScript page description language.  This for-mat is usually used for printing, and requires a printer that supports PostScript (there are also PostScript renderers that run entirely in software, but they tend to be slow and some-what unreliable).

"gIF, or graphics Interchange Format, is a bitmapped format promulgated  by  CompuServe.   Instead  of  reserving  enough space  to  store  a  large  number  of  colors  in  each  pixel,  this format  uses  a  color  table  that  can  hold  up  to  256  colors.  Each pixel contains a reference (index into) the color table.  This means that gIF works best with images that have rela-tively  few  colors  and  for  applications  (such  as  Web  pages) where compactness  is  important.  gIF  also  uses  compres-sion to achieve compactness, but unlike the case with JPEg it is a lossless compression called LZW.  There is also a gIF format that stores simple animations. ",0
"JPEg,  which  stands  for  Joint  Photographic  Experts group, is  widely  used  for  digital  cameras  because  of  its  ability  to highly  compress  the  data  in  a  color  graphics  image,  allow-ing  a  reasonable  number  of  high-resolution  pictures  to  be stored  in  the  camera’s  onboard  memory.   The  compression is “lossy,” meaning that information is lost during compres-sion ,.  At relatively low compression ratios (such as 10:1, or 10 percent of the original image size) changes  in  the  image  due  to  data  loss  are  unlikely  to  be         graphics formatsperceived by the human eye.  At higher ratios (approaching 100:1)  the  image  becomes  seriously  degraded.   JPEg’s  abil-ity to  store  thousands  of  colors  (unlike gIF’s  limit  of  256) makes  the  format  particularly  suitable  for  the  subtleties  of photography. ",0
PCx is a compressed bitmap format originally used by the popular PC Paintbrush program.  In recent years it has been largely supplanted by BmP and TIFF. ,0
"TIFF,  or  Tagged  Image  File  Format,  is  also  a  compressed bitmap  format.   There  are  several  variations  by  different vendors,  which  can  lead  to  compatibility  problems.

"While conventional pointing devices , are quite satisfactory  for  making  selections  and  even  manipulat-ing  objects,  many  artists  prefer  the  control  available  only through  a  pen  or  pencil,  which  allows  the  angle  and  pres-sure of the stylus tip to be varied, creating precise lines and shading.  A graphics tablet (also called a digitizing tablet) is a device that uses a specially wired pen or pencil with a flat surface (tablet).  Besides tracking the location of the pen and tra  nslating  it  into x/Y  screen  coordinates,  the  tablet  also has  pressure  sensors  (depending  on  sensitivity. the  tablet can recognize 256, 512, or 1024 levels of pressure).  In com-bination with buttons on the pen, the pressure level can be used  to  control  the  line  thickness,  transparency,  or  color.  In  addition,  the  driver  software  for  some  graphics  tablets includes additional functions such as the ability to program the  pen  to  control  features  of  such  applications  as  Adobe Photoshop.

"This is a general term for features that reduce the growing environmental impact of the manufacture or use of comput-ers.   This  impact  has  several  aspects:  energy  consumption, resource  consumption,  e-waste,  and  pollution  and  green-house emissions. ",0
"Computers consume a variety of resources, starting with their manufacturing and packaging.  Resource consumption can be reduced  by  building  more  compact  units  and  by  designing components so they can be more readily stripped and recycled or  reused.   Adopting  reusable  storage  media  (such  as  rewrit-able  CDs),  recycling  printer  toner  cartridges,  and  changing office  procedures  to  minimize  the  generation  of  paper  docu-ments are also ways to reduce resource consumption. ",0
"In recent years the disposal of obsolete computers and other electronic  equipment  (“e-waste”)  has  been  both  a  grow-ing  concern  and  a  business  opportunity.   There  are  many toxic substances in electronics components, including lead, mercury,  and  cadmium.   Processing  e-waste  to  recover  raw materials is expensive, so greater emphasis has been placed on  disassembling  machines  and  reusing  or  refurbishing their  individual  components.  meanwhile,  many  communi-ties have banned disposing of e-waste in regular trash, and some have offered opportunities to drop off e-waste at no or minimal  charge.   States  such  as  California  have  also  insti-tuted  a  recycling  fee  that  is  collected  upon  sale  of  devices such as CRT monitors and televisions. ",0
"Fabrication of computer chips in more than 200 large plants around the world involves a variety of toxic chemicals and waste products.  The Silicon Valley alone is home to 29 toxic sites under the EPA’s Superfund Program.  The shift of much of semiconductor and computer component manufacturing to  countries  such  as  China  that  have  less  strict  pollution controls  has  also  exacerbated  what  has  become  a  global problem. Whether through regulation or enlightened self-interest, companies  that  want  to  reduce  future  emissions  can  use several strategies.  manufacturing equipment and processes can be modified so they create fewer toxic substances or at least  keep  them  from  getting  into  the  environment.   Non-toxic  (or  less  toxic)  materials  can  be  substituted  where possible—for  example,  use  of  ozone-depleting  chlorofluo-rocarbons (CFCs) as cleaning agents has been largely elimi-nated.   Finally,  waste  can  be  properly  sorted  and  disposed of, and recycled wherever feasible. Like  other  major  manufacturing  sectors,  the  computer industry  is  also  faced  with  the  need  to  reduce  the  amount of  the  greenhouse  gases  (particularly  CO2)  contributing  to global  warming.   This  mainly  means  further  reducing  the energy  consumption  of  new  PCs.   In  June  2007  a  number of  major  players,  including google,  Intel,  Dell,  Hewlett-Packard, microsoft, and Sun, established the Climate Savers Computing  Initiative.  going  beyond  Energy  Star,  the  pro-gram  is  expected  to  reduce  power  consumption  equivalent to 54 million tons of greenhouse gases annually—about the same  as  that  produced  by  11  million  cars  or  20  large  coal-fired power plants.

"grid  or  cluster  computing  involves  the  creation  of  a  sin-gle  computer  architecture  that  consists  of  many  separate computers  that  function  much  like  a  single  machine.   The computers  are  usually  connected  using  fast  networks  ,.   The  purpose  of  the  arrangement can  be  to  provide  redundant  processing  in  case  of  system failures,  to  dynamically  balance  a  fluctuating  work  load, or  to  split  large  computations  into  many  parts  that  can  be performed  simultaneously.   This  latter  approach  to  “high-performance computing” creates the virtual equivalent of a very large and powerful machine. ",0
"grid  and  cluster  architectures  often  overlap,  but  the  term grid  tends  to  be  applied  to  a  more  loosely  coordinated structure  where  the  computers  are  dispersed  over  a  wider area  (not  a  local  network).   In  a  grid,  the  work  is  usually divided  into  many  separate  packets  that  can  be  processed independently without the computers having to share data.

"Fault  tolerance  is  a  design  concept  that  recognizes  that  all computer-based systems will fail eventually.  The question is whether a system as a whole can be designed to “fail grace-fully. ”  This  means  that  even  if  one  or  more  components fail,  the  system  will  continue  to  operate  according  to  its design  specifications,  even  if  its  speed  or  throughput  must decrease. ",0
"There  are  a  number  of  ways  to  make  a  system  more  fault tolerant.  Individual components such as hard drives can be composed of multiple units so that the remaining units can take over if one fails ,.  If each key component has at least one backup, then there should be time to replace the primary before the backup also fails. Another way to achieve fault tolerance is to provide mul-tiple paths to successful completion of the task.  In fact, this is  how  packet-switched  networks  like  the  Internet  work ,.   If  one  communications  link  is  down  or  too congested, packets are given an alternative routing. Fault diagnosis software can also play an important role both in determining how to respond to a problem (beyond any automatic response) and for providing data that will be useful  later  to  system  administrators  or  technicians.   Some fault diagnosis systems can use elaborate rules , to pinpoint the cause of a fault and recommend a solution. ",0
"The  amount  of  fault  tolerance  to  be  provided  for  a  sys-tem depends on a number of factors:,    How important is it that the system not fail?,      How critical is a given component to the operation of the system?,      How  likely  is  it  that  a  given  component  will  fail? (mean time between failures, or mBTF),      How expensive is it to make the component or system fault tolerant?",0
"A  fiber  optic  (or  optical  fiber)  cable  transmits  photons (light)  instead  of  electrons.   Depending  on  the  diameter  of the cable, the light is guided either by total internal reflec-tion  or  as  a  waveguide  (manipulating  refraction).   These principles were known as early as the mid-19th century and began to be used in the 20th century for such applications as  dental  and  medical  illumination  and  in  experiments  in transmitting images for television. ",0
"Optical  fiber  in  its  modern  form  was  developed  in  the 1950s.   The  glass  fiber  through  which  the  light  passes  is surrounded  by  a  transparent  cladding  designed  to  provide the needed refractive index to keep the light confined.  The cladding  in  turn  is  surrounded  by  a  resin  buffer  layer  and often an outer jacket and plastic cover.  Fiber used for com-munication is flexible, allowing it to bend if necessary. Early  optical  fiber  could  not  be  used  for  practical  com-munication because of progressive attenuation (weakening) of the light as it traveled.  However, by the 1970s the attenu-ation  was  being  reduced  to  acceptable  levels  by  removing impurities from the fibers.  Today the light signals can travel hundreds of miles without the need for repeaters or amplifi-ers.  In the 1990s a new type of optical fiber (photonic crys-tal)  using  diffraction  became  available.   This  kind  of  fiber is  particularly  useful  in  applications  that  require  higher power signals. ",0
"Optical  fiber  has  several  advantages  over  ordinary  electric cable  for  communications  and  networking.   The  signals  can travel much farther without the need for a repeater to boost the  signal.   Also,  the  ability  to  modulate  wavelengths  allows optical fiber to carry many separate channels, greatly increas-ing the total data throughput.  Optical fiber does not emit RF (radio  frequency)  energy,  a  source  of  “cross  talk”  (interfer-ence) in electrical cable.  Fiber is also more secure than elec-trical cable because it is hard for an eavesdropper to tap. Today  fiber  is  used  for  most  long-distance  phone  lines and Internet  connections.  many  cable  television  systems are  upgrading  from  video  cable  to  fiber  because  of  its greater reliability and ability to carry more bandwidth and enhanced data services.

"At bottom, information in a computer is stored as a series of bits,  which  can  be  grouped  into  larger  units  such  as  bytes or “words” that represent particular numbers or characters.  In  order  to  be  stored  and  retrieved,  a  collection  of  such binary  data  must  be  given  a  name  and  certain  attributes that  describe  how  the  information  can  be  accessed.   This named entity is the file. ",0
"The file system is the facility of the operating system that organizes files ,.  For example, on DOS and older Windows PCs, there is a file allocation table (FAT) that consists of a linked list of clusters (each cluster consists of a fixed number of sectors, varying with the overall size of the disk).  When the operating system is asked to access a file, it can go through the table and find the clusters belonging to that file, read the data and send it to the requesting applica-tio n.   modern  file  systems  further  organize  files  into  groups called folders or directories, which can be nested several lay-ers  deep.   Such  a  hierarchical  file  system  makes  it  easier  for users to organize the dozens of applications and thousands of files found on today’s PCs.  For example, a folder called Book might have a subfolder for each chapter, which in turn con-tains folders for text and illustrations relating to that chapter. ",0
"The  ultimate  organization  of  data  in  a  file  depends  on  the application.   A  typical  approach  is  to  define  a  data  record with  various  fields.   The  program  might  have  a  loop  that repeatedly  requests  a  record  from  the  file,  processes  it  in some  way,  and  repeats  until  the  operating  system  tells  it that  it  has  reached  the  end  of  the  file.   This  would  be  a sequential  access;  a  program  can  also  be  set  up  for ran-dom  access,  which  means  that  an  arbitrary  record  can  be requested  and  that  request  will  be  translated  into  the  cor-rect  physical  location  in  the  file.   The  two  approaches  can be combined in ISAm (Indexed Sequential Access method), where  the  records  are  stored  sequentially  but  fields  are indexed so a particular record can be retrieved. ",0
"The  growth  in  desktop  computing  since  the  1980s  has resulted  in  much  data  being  moved  from  mainframe  com-puters  to  desktop  PCs,  which  are  now  usually  linked  by networks.  While a network enables users to exchange files, there  remains  the  problem  of  storing  large  files  or  collec-tions of files (such as databases) that are too large for a typi-cal PC hard drive or that need to be accessed and updated by many users. The  common  solution  is  to  obtain  a  computer  with large,  fast  disk  drives  ,.   This  computer,  the file  server,  is  equipped  with  software  (often  included  with the  networking  package)  that  serves  (provides)  files  as requested  by  users  or  applications  on  the  other  PCs  on the  network.   (See  also client-seRveRcomputing. )  The specifics  of  configuring  the  server  for  optimum  efficiency, providing  adequate  security,  and  arranging  for  backup  or archiving varies with the particular network operating sys-tem  in  use  (the  most  popular  environments  are  Windows NT, Vista, and the various versions of UNIx and Linux)",0
"The  file  server  has  many  advantages  over  storing  the files needed by each user on his or her own PC.  By storing the files on a central server, ordinary users’ PCs do not need to have larger, more expensive disk drives.  Central storage also  makes  it  easier  to  ensure  that  backups  are  run  regularly. ",0
"File-sharing services allow participants to provide access to files  on  their  personal  computers,  such  as  music  or  video.  In turn, the user can browse the service to find and down-load material of interest.  The structure is generally that of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network with no central server. The  first  major  file-sharing  service  was  Napster.   This was  a  P2P  network  but  had  a  central  server  that  provided the  searchable  list  of  files  and  locations—but  not  the  files themselves,   which   were   downloaded   from   users’   PCs.  Napster  was  forced  to  close  in  2001  by  legal  action  from copyright  holders  ,.   A  new  but  unrelated  for-pay  service  opened  later under the same name. ",0
"many  services  today  use  the  popular  BitTorrent  file-shar-ing protocol.  A BitTorrent client (either the program of that name  or  another  compatible  one)  can  transmit  or  receive any  type  of  data.   To  share  a  file,  the  client  creates  a  “tor-rent”—a  small  file  that  contains  metadata  describing  the file and an assignment to a “tracker. ” The tracker is another computer  (node)  that  coordinates  the  distribution  of  the file.  Although this sounds complicated and a request takes longer  to  set  up  than  an  ordinary  HTTP  connection,  the advantage  is  that  once  set  up,  downloading  is  efficiently managed  even  for  files  for  which  there  is  high  demand.  The  downloading  client  connects  to  multiple  clients  that provide  pieces  of  the  desired  file.   Because  of  its  efficiency, BitTorrent allows for distribution of substantial amounts of data  at  low  cost,  particularly  since  the  system  “scales  up” automatically  without  having  to  provide  extra  resources.  BitTorrent  is  currently  being  used  for  a  variety  of  legally distributed  material,  including  video,  sound,  and  textual content ",0
"Because  of  their  frequent  use  to  share  copyrighted  music, video, or other material, a variety of organizations of copy-right  owners  have  sued  file-sharing  services  and/or  their users.   The  biggest  problem  for  the  courts  is  to  determine whether  there  is  “substantial  non-infringing  use”—that  is, the service is being used to exchange legal data. Some  file-sharing  services  have  been  accused  of  dis-tributing  malware  (viruses  or  spyware)  or  of  being  used to  distribute  material  that  is  illegal  per  se  (such  as  child pornography). In  response  to  litigation  threats,  file-sharing  services have tended to become more decentralized, and some have features  that  increase  anonymity  of  users  , or use encryption. ",0
"With  today’s  networked  PCs  and  the  use  of  e-mail  attach-ments  it  is  easy  to  send  a  copy  of  a  file  or  files  from  one computer  to  another,  because  networks  already  include  all the  facilities  for  doing  so.   Earlier,  many  PCs  were  not  net-worked  but  could  be  connected  via  a  dial-up  modem.   To established the connection, a terminal program running on one  PC  had  to  negotiate  with  its  counterpart  on  the  other machine,  agreeing  on  whether  data  would  be  sent  in  7-  or 8-bit  chunks,  and  the  number  of  parity  bits  that  would  be included  for  error-checking  ,.   The sending  program  would  inform  the  receiving  program  as to  the  name  and  basic  type  of  the  file.   For  binary  files (files  intended  to  be  interpreted  as  literal  binary  codes,  as with executable programs, images, and so on) the contents would be sent unchanged.  For text files, there might be the issue of which character set (7- bit or 8-bit ASCII) was being used, and whether the ends of lines were to be marked with a  CR  (carriage  return)  character,  an  LF  (linefeed),  or  bot",0
"Once the programs agree on the basic parameters for a file transfer,  the  transfer  has  to  be  managed  to  ensure  that  it completes  correctly.   Typically,  files  are  divided  into  blocks of data (such as 1K, or 1024 bytes each).  During the 1970s, Ward Christensen developed xmodem, the first widely used file transfer program for PCs running CP/m (and later, mS-DOS and other operating systems).  xmodem was quite reli-able because it incorporated a checksum (and later, a more advanced  CRC)  to  check  the  integrity  of  each  data  block.  If  an  error  is  detected,  the  receiving  program  requests  a retransmission. ",0

"There are many calculations or other processes that can be described using a specific series of states or conditions.  For example,  the  state  of  a  combination  lock  depends  not  only on what numeral is being dialed or punched at the moment, but  on  the  numbers  that  have  been  previously  entered.   An even simpler example is a counter (such as a car odometer), whose  next  output  is  equal  to  one  increment  plus  its  cur-rent  setting.   In  other  words,  a  state-based  device  has  an inherent “memory” of previous steps. ",0
"many programs and operating systems are structured as an endless  loop  where  an  input  (or  command)  is  processed, the  results  returned,  the  next  input  is  processed,  and  so on, until an exit command is received.  A mode or state can be  used  to  determine  the  system’s  activity.   For  example,  a program  might  be  in  different  modes  such  as  waiting  for input,  processing  input,  displaying  results,  and  so  on.   The program  logic  will  refer  to  the  current  state  to  determine what  to  do  next  and  at  some  point  the  logic  will transitionthe system to the next state in the sequence.  The validity of some kinds of programs, protocols, or circuits can therefore be proven by showing that there is an equivalent finite-state machine—and thus that all possible combinations of inputs have been accounted for. Finite-state machines have many other interesting appli-cations.  Simple organisms can be modeled as a set of states that  interact  with  the  environment .  The lower-level functions of robots can also be represented as  a  set  of  interacting  finite-state  machines.   Even  video game characters often use FSms to give them a repertoire of plausible behavior. ",0

If the flag is false, the input form might be redis-played with errors or omissions highlighted. ",0
"In computers, the term ""flash mob"" typically refers to a group of individuals who organize a spontaneous and coordinated online activity, such as a social media campaign or an online protest.  Flash mobs often use social media platforms and other online tools to mobilize large groups of people quickly and efficiently. Flash mobs can take many different forms, ranging from coordinated tweets or Facebook posts to more elaborate online events such as virtual marches or protests.  They are often used to draw attention to a particular cause, raise awareness about an issue, or promote a message or idea. ",0
"Smart  mobs  are  similar  in  organization  to  flash  mobs  but tend  to  be  more  purposeful  and  enduring  forms  of  social organization.  The phenomenon was first described by How-ard  Rheingold  in  his  book Smart  Mobs:  The  Next  Social Revolution ,.  Rheingold describes several examples of smart mobs, including teenage “thumb tribes” in Tokyo and Helsinki, Finland (named for their use of  tiny  thumb-operated  keyboards  on  cell  phones).   Their typical  activities  included  organizing  impromptu  raves  or converging on rock stars or other celebrities. ",0

"A flowchart is a diagram showing the “flow” or progress of operations  in  a  computer  program.   Flowcharting  was  one of  the  earliest  aids  to  program  design  and  documentation, and a plastic template with standard flowcharting symbols was a common programming accessory.  Today CASE (com-puter-aided  software  engineering)  systems  often  include utilities  that  can  automatically  generate  flowcharts  based on  the  control  structures  and  procedure  calls  found  in  the program code. The standard flowchart symbols include blocks of vari-ous  shapes  that  represent  input/output,  data  processing, sorting and collating, and so on.  Lines with arrows indicate the  flow  of  data  from  one  stage  or  process  to  the  next.   A diamond-shaped  symbol  indicates  a  decision  to  be  made by  the  program.   If  the  decision  is  an  “if”  ,  separate  lines  branch  off  to  the  alternatives.  If the decision involves repeated testing ,, the line returns  back  to  the  decision  point  while  another  line  indi-cates  the  continuation  of  processing  after  the  loop  exits.  Devices  such  as  printers  and  disk  drives  have  their  own symbols  with  lines  indicating  the  flow  of  data  to  or  from the device",0
"In computing, a font refers to a typeface that has a distinc-tive  appearance  and  style.   In  most  word  processing,  desk-top publishing, and other programs the user can select the point  size  at  which  the  font  is  to  be  displayed  and  printed (in traditional typography each point size would be consid-ered to be a separate font).  Operating systems such as Win-A flowchart uses a set of simple symbols to describe the steps involved in a data processing operation.  The parallelograms indi-cate an input/output operation (such as reading or writing a file).  The “decision diamonds” have yes and no branches depending on the result of a test or comparison. 00        flowchartdows  and macintosh  usually  come  with  an  assortment  of fonts, and applications can register additional fonts to make them available to the system. ",0
"There  are  two  basic  ways  to  store  font  data  in  the computer  system.   Bitmapped  fonts  store  the  actual  pat-tern of tiny dots that make up the letters in the font.  This has  the  advantage  of  allowing  each  letter  in  each  point size  to  be  precisely  designed.   The  primary  disadvantage is  the  amount  of  memory  and  system  resources  required to  store  a  font  in  many  point  sizes.   In  practice,  this  con-sideration  results  in  only  a  relatively  few  fonts  and  sizes being available. ",0
"Forth  has  a  very  simple  structure.   The  Forth  system  con-sists  of  a  collection  of words.   Each  word  is  a  sequence  of operations  (which  can  include  other  existing  words).   For example, the DUP word makes a copy of a data value.  Data is  held  by  a  stack.   For  example,  the  arithmetic  expression written  as  2  +  3  in  most  languages  would  be  written  in Forth  as  +  2  3.   When  the  +  operator  (which  in  Forth  is  a pre-defined  word)  executes,  it  adds  the  next  two  numbers it  encounters  (2  and  3)  together,  and  puts  the  sum  on  the stack (where in turn it might be fetched for further process-ing by the next word in the program ,.  This rep-resentation  is  also  called postfix  notation  and  is  familiar  to many users of scientific calculators. ",0
"A key feature of Forth is its extensibility.  Once you have defined a word, the new word can be used in exactly the same way  as  the  predefined  words.   The  various  forms  of defining words allow for great control over what happens when a new word  is  created  and  when  the  word  is  later  executed.   (In many ways Forth anticipated the principles of object-oriented programming, with words as objects with implicit construc-tors and methods.  A well-organized Forth program builds up from  “primitive”  operations  to  the  higher-level  words,  with the program itself being the highest-level word. )",0
"Fortran  (FORmula  TRANslator)  was  the  first  widely used  high-level  programming  language.   It  was  developed by a project begun in 1954 by a team under the leadership of I  Bm researcher John Backus.  The goal of the project was to create a language that would allow mathematicians, sci-entists, and engineers to express calculations in something close  to  the  traditional  notation.   At  the  same  time,  a  com-piler  would  have  to  be  carefully  designed  so  that  it  would produce  executable  machine  code  that  would  be  nearly  as efficient as the code that would have been created through the more tedious process of using assembly languages.

"Fractals  and  the  related  idea  of  chaos  have  profoundly changed  the  way  scientists  think  about  and  model  the world.   Around  1960,  Benoit mandelbrot  noticed  that  sup-posedly random economic fluctuations were not distributed evenly but tended to form “clumps. ” As he investigated other sources of data, he found that many other things exhibited this  odd  behavior.   He  also  discovered  that  the  patterns  of distribution were “self-similar”—that is, if you magnified a portion of the pattern it looked like a miniature copy of the whol  e.   mandelbrot  coined  the  term fractal  (meaning  frac-tured, or broken up) to describe such patterns.  Eventually, a  number  of  simple  mathematical  functions  were  found  to exhibit such behavior in generating values. ",0
"many  computer  users  are  familiar  with  the  colorful  fractal patterns  generated  by  some  screen  savers.   There  are  hun-dreds  of  “families”  of  fractals  (beginning  with  the  famous mandelbrot  set)  that  can  be  color-coded  and  displayed  in endless  detail.   But  there  are  a  number  of  more  significant applications.   Because  of  their  ability  to  generate  realistic textures at every level of detail, many computer games and simulations  use  fractals  to  generate  terrain  interactively.  Fractals  can  also  be  used  to  compress  large  digital  images into  a  much  smaller  equivalent  by  creating  a  mathemati-cal  transformation  that  preserves  (and  can  be  used  to  re-cre  ate)  the  essential  characteristics  of  the  image.  military experts can use fractal analysis either to distinguish artifi-cial  objects  from  surrounding  terrain  or  camouflage,  or  to generate more realistic camouflage.  Fractals and chaos the-ory are likely to produce many surprising discoveries in the future, in areas ranging from signal analysis and encryption to economic forecasting. ",0
"Functional languages have generally been used for special-ized  purposes,  although  they  can  in  principle  perform  any task  that  an  imperative  language  can.   APL,  which  is  basi-cally a functional language, has devotees who appreciate its compact  and  powerful  syntax  for  performing  calculations ,.   LISP  and  its  variants  have  long  been  favored  for many  artificial  intelligence  applications,  particularly  natu-ral language processing, where its representation of data as lists and the facility of its list-processing functions seems a natural fit. Proponents of functional languages argue that they free the  programmer  from  having  to  be  concerned  with  explic-itly setting up and using variables.  In a functional language, problems can often be stated in a more purely mathematical way.   Further,  because  functional  programs  are  not  orga-nized  as  sequentially  executed  tasks,  it  may  be  easier  to implement  parallel  processing  systems  using  functional languages. However, critics point out that imperative languages are much  closer  to  how  computers  actually  work  (employing actual storage locations and sequential operation) and thus produce  code  likely  to  be  much  faster  and  more  efficient than that produced by functional languages.

"At  bottom,  a  data  bit  in  a  computer  is  “all  or  nothing” (1  or  0).  most  decisions  in  computer  code  are  also  all  or nothing: Either a condition is satisfied, and execution takes one  specified  path,  or  the  condition  is  not  satisfied  and  it goes  elsewhere.   In  real  life,  of  course,  many  situations  fall between the cracks.  For example, a business might want to treat  a  credit  applicant  who  almost  qualifies  for  “A”  status different  from  one  who  barely  made  “B. ”  While  a  program could be refined to include many gradations between B and A, another approach is to express the degree of “closeness” (or certainty) using fuzzy logic.

"In the early 1950s, knowledge of computing tended to have and hoc nature.  On the practical level, computing staffs tended to train newcomers in the specific hardware and machine-level programming languages in use at a particular site.  On the theoretical level, programmers in scientific fields were likely to come from a background in electronics, electrical engineering, or similar disciplines. As it became clear that computers were going to play an increasingly important role, courses specific to computing were added to curricula in mathematics and engineering.  By the late 1950s, however, leading people in the computing field had become convinced that a formal curriculum in computer science was necessary for further advance in an increasingly sophisticated computing arena .  By the early 1960s, efforts at the University of Michigan, University of Houston, Stanford, and other institutions had resulted in the creation of separate graduate departments of computer science.  By the mid-1960s, the National Academy of Sciences and the President’s Science Advisory Committee had both called for a major expansion of efforts in computer science education to be aided by federal funding.  During the 1970s and 1980s, mathematical and engineering societies (in particular the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE) worked to established detailed computer science curricula that extended to undergraduate study.  By 2000, there were 155 accredited  programs in computer science in the United States. ",0
"BASIC was invented at Dartmouth College in 1963–1964 by John G.  Kemeny and Thomas E.  Kurtz, both professors of mathematics, assisted by a group of undergraduate student programmers.  Computers then were huge, slow, and expensive; there were no personal computers.  Their goal was to bring easy and accessible computing to all students, not just science or engineering students.  The method they chose called for developing a time-shared operating system, which would allow many users simultaneously.  (This operating system was developed entirely by Dartmouth undergraduate students. ) The new language, BASIC, easy to learn and easy to use, was an essential part of this effort.  BASIC was thus developed originally for a large multipleuser, time-shared system and not for personal computers, which did not appear widely until the early 1980s.  It has been asked whyBASICwas invented.  Couldn’t an existing language have been used for the purpose? The answer to the second question is no, which also answers the first question.  Other computer languages did exist in 1963, although there were not nearly as many as there are today.  The principal ones were FORTRAN and Algol; most of the others are long since forgotten.  Some of the common languages used today—C, C++, and Java—had not even been conceived.  FORTRAN and Algol were each considered briefly.  These languages were designed for production use on big machines or for scientific research, using punched cards.  But neither was suitable for use by beginners, neither was particularly well suited for a time-shared environment, and neither permitted speedy handling of short programs.  Kemeny and Kurtz had experimented with other simple computer languages as early as 1956, but with only modest success.  So, in 1963, when they began building a time-shared system for students, they quickly realized that a new language had to be invented—BASIC. ",0
"Timing attacks were publicized by Paul Kocher in 1996.  They attack the implementation of cryptosystems by measuring observable differences in the timing of the algorithm based on the particular value of the key.  They then use statistical methods to determine the bits of key by observing many operations using the same key.  Timing attacks typically require a significant number of chosen ciphertexts.  Related attacks can use any measure of differences in the performance of the encryption and decryption functions such as power consumption and heat dissipation.  Timing attacks and related attacks can be protected against to some degree by “blinding” the devices performing encryption and decryption computations so that all computations have the same performance, regardless of the particular key and message being used.  However, this can have a substantial performance cost, as it requires all computations to have worst-case performance.  Such attacks can also be protected against by designing systems so that they will not act as an “oracle” by decrypting and returning all and any messages that come their way, thereby preventing an attacker from obtaining the necessary data to carry out the attack.  However, this is not always possible without interfering with the purpose of the system. ",0
"The  arithmetic  logic  unit  is  the  part  of  a  computer  system that actually performs calculations and logical comparisons on data.  It is part of the central processing unit (CPU), and in  practice  there  may  be  separate  and  multiple  arithmetic and logic units ,. The ALU works by first retrieving a code that represents the operation to be performed (such as ADD).  The code also specifies the location from which the data is to be retrieved and  to  which  the  results  of  the  operation  are  to  be  stored.  (For example, addition of the data from memory to a num-ber  already  stored  in  a  special  accumulator  register  within the CPU, with the result to be stored back into the accumu-lator. )  The  operation  code  can  also  include  a  specification of the format of the data to be used (such as fixed or float-ing-point  numbers)—the  operation  and  format  are  often combined into the same code. In  addition  to  arithmetic  operations,  the  ALU  can  also carry  out  logical  comparisons,  such  as  bitwise  operations that compare corresponding bits in two data words, corresponding to Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and xOR ,. The  data  or  operand  specified  in  the  operation  code  is retrieved as words of memory that represent numeric data, or  indirectly,  character  data  ,.  Once the operation is per-formed,  the  result  is  stored  (typically  in  a  register  in  the CPU).   Special  codes  are  also  stored  in  registers  to  indicate characteristics  of  the  result  (such  as  whether  it  is  positive, negative,  or  zero).   Other  special  conditions  called  excep-tions  indicate  a  problem  with  the  processing.   Common exceptions include overflow, where the result fills more bits than are available in the register, loss of precision (because there  isn’t  room  to  store  the  necessary  number  of  decimal places),  or  an  attempt  to  divide  by  zero.   Exceptions  are typically  indicated  by  setting  a  flag  in  the  machine  status register.  ",0
"An  applet  is  a  small  program  that  uses  the  resources  of  a larger program and usually provides customization or addi-tional  features.   The  term  first  appeared  in  the  early  1990s in  connection  with  Apple’s  AppleScript  scripting  language for the macintosh operating system.  Today Java applets rep-resent the most widespread use of this idea in Web develop-ment ,. Java  applets  are  compiled  to  an  intermediate  repre-sentation  called  bytecode,  and  generally  are  run  in  a  Web browser  ,.   Applets  thus  represent  one of  several  alternatives  for  interacting  with  users  of  Web pages  beyond  what  can  be  accomplished  using  simple  text markup  ,. An  applet  can  be  invoked  by  inserting  a  reference  to its  program  code  in  the  text  of  the  Web  page,  using  the HTmL applet element or the now-preferred object element.  Although  the  distinction  between  applets  and  scripting code  (such  as  in  PHP)  is  somewhat  vague,  applets  usually run  in  their  own  window  or  otherwise  provide  their  own interface,  while  scripting  code  is  generally  used  to  tailor the  behavior  of  separately  created  objects.   Applets  are  also rather  like  plug-ins,  but  the  latter  are  generally  used  to provide  a  particular  capability  (such  as  the  ability  to  read or  play  a  particular  kind  of  media  file),  and  have  a  stan-dardized facility for their installation and management ,. Some  common  uses  for  applets  include  animations  of scientific or programming concepts for Web pages support-ing  class  curricula  and  for  games  designed  to  be  played using  Web  browsers.   Animation  tools  such  as  Flash  and Shockwave are often used for creating graphic applets. To  prevent  badly  or  maliciously  written  applets  from affecting  user  files,  applets  such  as  Java  applets  are  gen-erally  run  within  a  restricted  or  “sandbox”  environment where, for example, they are not allowed to write or change files on disk.

"In  personal  computers  a  chipset  is  a  group  of  integrated circuits that together perform a particular function.  System purchasers  generally  think  in  terms  of  the  processor  itself (such  as  a  Pentium  III,  Pentium  IV,  or  competitive  chips from AmD  or  Cyrix).   However  they  are  really  buying  a system  chipset  that  includes  the  microprocessor  itself  , and often a memory cache (which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip—see cache) as  well  as  the  chips  that  control  the  memory  bus  (which connects  the  processor  to  the  main  memory  on  the  moth-erboard—see bus. )  The  overall  performance  of  the  system depends not just on the processor’s architecture (including data  width,  instruction  set,  and  use  of  instruction  pipe-lines)  but  also  on  the  type  and  size  of  the  cache  memory, the memory  bus  (RDRAm  or  “Rambus”  and  SDRAm)  and the  speed  with  which  the  processor  can  move  data  to  and from memory. In addition to the system chipset, other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics (the AgP,  or  Advanced graphics  Port,  for  example),  drive connection  (EIDE  controller),  communication  with  exter-nal devices ,, and connections to expansion cards (the PCI bus). At  the  end  of  the  1990s,  the  PC  marketplace  had  chip-sets  based  on  two  competing  architectures.   Intel,  which originally  developed  an  architecture  called  Socket  7,  has switched  to  the  more  complex  Slot-1  architecture,  which is  most  effective  for  multiprocessor  operation  but  offers the advantage of including a separate bus for accessing the cac  he memory.  meanwhile,  Intel’s  main  competitor,  AmD, has  enhanced  the  Socket  7  into  “Super  Socket  7”  and  is offering  faster  bus  speeds.   On  the  horizon  may  be  com-pletely  new  architecture.   In  choosing  a  system,  consumers are locked into their choice because the microprocessor pin sockets used for each chipset architecture are different. ",0
"A  class  is  a  data  type  that  combines  both  a  data  structure and  methods  for  manipulating  the  data.   For  example,  a string  class  might  consist  of  an  array  to  hold  the  charac-ters in the string and methods to compare strings, combine strings,  or  extract  portions  of  a  string  ,. As  with  other  data  types,  once  a  class  is  declared, objects  (sometimes  called  instances)  of  the  class  can  be created  and  used.   This  way  of  structuring  programs  is called   object-oriented   programming   because   the   class object  is  the  basic  building  block  ,. Object-oriented  programming  and  classes  provide  sev-eral advantages over traditional block-structured languages.  In  a  traditional  BASIC  or  even  Pascal  program,  there  is no  particular  connection  between  the  data  structure  and the  procedures  or  functions  that  manipulate  it.   In  a  large program  one  programmer  might  change  the  data  structure without  alerting  other  programmers  whose  code  assumes the  original  structure.   On  the  other  hand,  someone  might write  a  procedure  that  directly  manipulates  the  internal data rather than using the methods already provided.  Either transgression can lead to hard-to-find bugs. With  a  class,  however,  data  and  procedures  are  bound together,  or  encapsulated.   This  means  that  the  data  in  a class  object  can  be  manipulated  only  by  using  one  of  the methods  provided  by  the  class.   If  the  person  in  charge of  maintaining  the  class  decides  to  provide  an  improved implementation  of  the  data  structure,  as  long  as  the  data parameters  expected  by  the  class  methods  do  not  change, code  that  uses  the  class  objects  will  continue  to  function properly.

"access Control Matrix means preparing a system permitting to bring together user and the system’s available resources.  Preparing a matrix requires the following steps: A broad level of groups of resources that share the same or similar security objectives is established based on requirements for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, User Accountability, Authentication and Audit (Compliance) (CIA UAA).  The resources include files, directories, applications, databases, hosts services, processes and others including those protected by the operating system or by other mechanisms.  Users are grouped according to common security needs into functional teams and a group owner is identified who is responsible for group management If necessary, naming standards for resources can be defined based on the findings under 1 & 2 above, thereby further facilitating resource groupings.  Now a decision can be made on the degree of access such as read, write, execute, take ownership, access control, delete, purge, modify, file scan ,.  Balancing central security control and group administration decides about the involvement of security administration.  A corporation’s access control matrix should not become a static document but, instead, regular review and improvement is a must.  This matrix is closely linked to a Role-Based Access management system, whereby user roles (e. g. , nurse versus private or general physician) have roles to perform requiring access and modification of data or addition of new information regarding an electronic patient file.

"Active OS Fingerprinting is conducted in order to detect the target’s Oper ating System.  It is usually done by sending specially crafted network packets and comparing them against known responses.  Each operating system re sponds to different packet differently and even response to the ping command can give a good indication of the target OS.  Several methods have been developed and fingerprints are widely available on the internet.  The tool of the trade for this is a tool called Network Mapper (nmap).  While Active OS Fingerprinting is more accurate than Passive OS Fingerprinting, it has a significant disadvantage.  Being active, means that attackers have to send packets to the host, hence, Active versus passive Fingerprinting means risking discovery ,. ",0

An ASP is somewhat similarto a server-side include or a common gateway interface (CGI) application inthat it involves programs that run on the server, usually tailoring a page forthe user.  Typically, the script in the web page at the server uses input receivedas the result of the user’s request for the page to access data from a database,thereafter it builds or customizes the page on the fly before sending it to therequestor.

"are similar to Java applets in that ActiveX controls may be includedwithin a web page.  The control is downloaded and executed on the browser’scomputer in the form of a pre-compiled executable.  Unfortunately, ActiveXdoes not enforce any form of security management technology.  Hence, ActiveX control has the same level of control of the client computer as theuser that is executing the browser.  ActiveX controls are specific to MicrosoftInternet Explorer (MSIE). ActiveX controls are elements that can be added to web pages, therebyproviding them with more functionality (e. g. , animation, video, and threedimensional browsing).  The controls are written in programming languagessuch as Visual Basic, C or C++.  They are written in a different code than theone used for the web pages itself such as HTML.  They could, however, beinfected with malicious code (Malware). Whatever risks are associated with running native executables on a computer also apply to ActiveX.  How security of ActiveX controls is handled isat the user’s discretion who runs the browser.  Without appropriate training this may be risky, justifying disabling this functionality within webbrowsers by setting security settings to ‘high,’ ActiveX is prevented fromrunning",0
"Advisory and Notification Markup Language (ANML) is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) -based specification for describing advisories and other types of notifications.  ANML is currently being developed to help in solving the inconsistent use of terminology by software vendors in their advisories.  The hope is that ANML will make it easy for applications to read these advisories.  This will make way for the necessary tools to automatically update systems.  Although ANML will have its biggest impact for security advisories, it can be used for any type of notification.  Some examples include bug-fixes, feature enhancements, upgrade availability, and many more.  More information can be found in Appendix 1 (Opensec) and Appendix 6 under ADML",0
"pronounced AL-go-rith-um is a procedure or formula for solving a problem.  The word derives from the name of the mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850.  Al-Khwarizmi’s work is the likely source for the word algebra as well.  Algorithm is any well-defined procedure (does not have to be computa tional) that takes some value or set of values as input and produces some value or set of values as output.  It is a technique that comes with a guarantee.  The technique for ratio nal function integration is an algorithm because it always produces the an swer, without exception.  Differentiation is an algorithm—given an elemen tary function, you can always find its derivative.  Algorithms can be fast or slow, but the important thing is the guarantee.  In some sense, an algorithm is a ‘predictable heuristic,’ whereby one cannot tell if a heuristic will work, before one tries it, but one knows in advance what the output of an algorithm will be.  In computing terms, algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input to the output.  A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm.  In mathe matics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.  In this context the term Virus Algorithm means a set of operations or a procedure designed to create a virus problem.  In the context of Digital Signatures or Encryption, the algorithm describes how the signature or text is encrypted using mathematical formulas Another example is the Condensation algorithm (Conditional Density Propagation) that allows quite general representations of probability.  The simplicity of the Condensation algorithm also allows the use of non-linear motion models more complex than those commonly used in Kalman filters.  Using the statistical technique of importance sampling it is possible to build a Condensation tracker which runs in real time tracking a dancer or a hand as they move",0
Apache is a freely available multiplatform web server.  It is currently the most commonly used server on internet connected sites.  Its genesis was in early 1995 when developers of some high visibility web sites decided to pool their patches and enhancements to the NCSA / 1. 3 server to create a patchy server.  The project has since gained considerable momentum. ,0
"ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a series of standards used to identify simple characters (numbers, letters, etc. ) where each character is represented by a numerical code.  Each character is assigned a 7-bit code, whereby the bit has a minimum unit of data, 0 (zero) or 1.  ASCII files can be created using simple text editors.  ASCII is a universal computer code for English letters and characters.  Computers store all information as binary numbers, regardless of what make or brand the computer is.  ASCII also refers to a protocol for copying files from one computer to another over a network, in which neither computer checks for any errors that might have been caused by static or other problems.  The difficulty with ASCII is twofold: 1) 2) all special fonts and elements used in a document typed using one software (e. g. , WordPerfect) will be lost when the file / document is saved in ASCII format and than reloaded by somebody else into WordPerfect (or even Microsoft Word for that matter), and special characters such as those used in German cannot be transferred by ASCII (e. g. , ü is transferred as a blank and an ue must be typed instead).  Besides German, for many languages (e. g. , Chinese and Japanese), this represents a real problem.  For the above reasons, a new source called Unicode was developed ,.  As 8 bit codes only allow for 256 separate characters, a single 8-bit en coding is not suitable for all text requirements.  Even western alphabets have many ‘characters’, and once languages of China, and Braille are included there are many thousands of characters that are needed.  Of course, within a given domain, an implicit assumption of a particular character set could be made.  This leads to multiple 8-bit codes.  But it doesn’t work for those character sets where more than 256 characters are needed in the same context.  Both 7-bit ASCII and the various 8-bit extensions of it can be considered to be subsets of Unicode.  One does not need to know the above level of detail, but it is important to see why ASCII is insufficient, and why a standard is required for character encodings ,. ",0
"Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) allows voice, video anddata to be transmitted over a single telephone line at up to 6. 144 megabitsper second (Mbps) in a single direction, with significantly slower speedsin the other direction.  Accordingly, it is very appropriate for downloading large amounts of data but for certain applications, such as videoconferencing, other technologies work better [see also Very-High-bit-rateDigital Subscriber Line (VDSL), Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) modulation,Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM-VDSL)].

"Attack is a single unauthorized access attempt, or unauthorized use attempt,regardless of success.  Success may or may not result in the alteration, releasing or denying of data.  The likelihood of success depends on the effectivenessof implemented security measures that reduce the risk and probability for athreat resulting in a compromised system ,.  Computernetworks make it easier to start attacks and speed their dissemination, or forone anonymous individual to reach vast numbers of people at virtually nocost. Defending against Attacks means engineering in a world ruled by Satan’sLaw.  The differences between Attacks and Accidents are intent, intelligence,and control.

Authentication results in positively verifying the identity of a user‚ device‚ or another entity in an information system.  This is often a prerequisite for allowing access to resources offered by a system.  One element that contributes to the reliability of individual authentication is good password management practices.  In an area of high risk‚ stronger authentication may be required such as: Asymmetric Keys—see Access Control Biometrics—see Biometrics Cryptographic Tokens—see Cryptography Digital Certificates—see Digital Certificate Smart Cards—see Smart Card One-Time Password Generators—where password can be used once only.  Stronger authentication relies on combining one or more of the following: password / Pin or something else user knows‚ token or other means‚ that is something user has‚ and finally‚ biometrics or other technique enabling system to identify who the person is.  The above means may be used to verify the true source of a message or data.  But all approaches have their weak spots and combinations of measures are usually more effective.  In case of electronic voting‚ the term refers to verification that an electronic ballot really comes from the person it claims to have been initiated by‚ and not from an imposter. ,0
Backdoor is a hidden feature of an application prepared by its designer ormaintainers.  The backdoor gives the programmer special privileges for running the application.  These privileges are not available to the user. The motivation for such holes is not always sinister; some operating systems‚ for example‚ come out of the box with privileged accounts intended foruse by field service technicians or the vendor’s maintenance programmers. But we are not sure if such an account should be called backdoor – in ourunderstanding‚ backdoor is a hidden feature.  Yes‚ these accounts were sometimes hidden‚ Microsoft NT 3. 51 and then they could be called backdoors‚but generally they are not hidden. ,0
Batch Files are files usually describing automated sequence of commands. These are used in mainframe operations where even special languages weredeveloped for creation of batches.  Shell scripts known in the UNIX worldcan also be considered in some cases as batch files.  In MS-DOS and MSWindows context‚ these files are characterized by a . BAT extension.  Thesetext files contain MS-DOS commands‚ one on each line of the file that areprocessed in sequential order‚ for example when the computer is booted (e. g. ‚Autoexec. bat). ,0

"Biometrics identification systems are based on the recognition of unique morphological characteristics of each individual‚ so that only the physical presence of the person will allow access to the system.  Numerous biometric parameters are available such as: facial‚ iris‚ fingerprints‚ hand and finger geometry‚ signature and voice recognition.  Although iris recognition has stronger security credentials‚ fingerprints are often preferred due to the maturity of the technology ,.  As Table 4A outlines‚ Retina Scan‚ Iris Scan and Hand Geometry are most accurate and both‚ the False Rejection Rate (FRR) and the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) are quite low for these Authentication measures based on Biometrics.  In Table 4B other measures are outlined that can be used for Access Control.  Often a system may use a Magnetic Swipe Card and a Keypad Entry System to give an employee access to a restricted office area or a database.  Some of the time a system such as the ones outlined in Table 4B may also be combined with one of those described and explained in Table 4C.  Unfortunately‚ all the one’s in Table 4C do have‚ however‚ some severe weaknesses that limit their Reliability and Validity.  In particular the FRR and FAR may not be satisfactory.  For instance‚ during May 2002 a Japanese group of researchers reported that using fake fingerprints fashioned from gelatin were able to fool biometric fingerprint readers 80% of the time.  The researchers also devised a way to create fake fingerprints from fingerprints left on glass surfaces.  What is interesting is that the material needed to make this work‚ was purchased at a neighborhood store and cost less than Euro 11.  This attack is a classic replay (or forgery) attack.  Unfortunately‚ replays are not unique to fingerprints but are a fundamental Vulnerability of all Biometrics ,.  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) published a report during May 2002 about the inaccuracy of tests using facial recognition technology at the Palm Beach (FL) International Airport.  The technology failed to correctly identify faces more than half of the time.  The recognition rate went down when people wore glasses‚ turned their heads‚ or were moving. ",0

"Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a plan to ensure that the essential business functions of the organization are able to continue (or re-start) in the event of unforeseen circumstances; normally a disaster of some sort ,.  The BCP follows the Disaster Recovery Plan ,.  BCP identifies the critical people and their roles and functions while the BCP is in force‚ information‚ systems‚ and other infrastructures (e. g. ‚ telephones‚ servers‚ SMS gateways) that are required to enable the business to operate again fully.  The BCP lays out a detailed plan which‚ if called upon‚ should be executed to assure minimum additional disruption after a massive computer Virus Attack or disaster.  Companies that do not have clear business continuity plans remain very vulnerable.  Good recovery from a disaster is‚ however‚ contingent upon people‚ processes and training.  Finally‚ management awareness may be the main weakness in business continuity planning.  Doing the basics well is they key‚ whereby if one says one will take his or her data off site within 24 hours of a calamity‚ one must make sure that this is being done.  Hence‚ fire drills or ‘dress rehearsals’ by simulating various disaster scenarios will permit the organization to be in a better position‚ while recovering faster after a disaster.  Hence‚ business continuity and disaster recovery plans need to be exercised so that kinks may be worked out before the crisis hits. ",0
Disk Cache is a temporary storage place that a computer can use to storea file after reading it from the hard drive.  For instance‚ telling a computerto open a MP3 file‚ it may take several seconds for it to locate and read thefile into memory from the PCs hard drive.  However‚ if the computer storesthe file in the Disk Cache‚ the next time one wishes to open the same file‚data can be retrieved from the disk cache rather than loading it from the harddrive. One definition refers to a Disk Cache specifically as: hard disk-based memory used to store accessed web pages.  This technique enables the browserload the stored pages from the cache rather than from the network.  That iswhy clicking the ‘Back’ button on a browser usually retrieves a page nearlyinstantaneously.  The virtual memory system that comes with Microsoft Windows is also another example of disk caching to increase performance,0
File Cache is used to store the locations of frequently used files for quickreference.  When open a file that is stored on a hard drive‚ the computer willfirst check for the file name (and location) in the file cache.  If it finds thisinformation‚ the computer can jump immediately to the correct place on ahard drive without having to search in the file allocation table (a type of tableof contents for a computer’s hard drive).  Because read/write heads on a harddrive have to physically move across the disk to search for them‚ it takes timefor the computer to search the hard drive for files‚ that is why using the cacheis fasterISPs may also be required to pay copyright fees when caching in the nearfuture. ,0
Web Cache is closely related to Disk Caching and occurs between webservers and a client or many clients.  It watches requests for HTML pages‚images and files to come by‚ saving a copy for itself.  Then‚ if there is anotherrequest for the same object‚ it will use the copy that it has‚ instead of askingthe origin server for it again. This type of caching may‚ however‚ infringe upon copyrights and publishers and music distributors are trying to find a solution for this problem,0

Public Key Infrastructure is needed as a means of generating and managing the encryption keys is required.  It is the use and management of cryptographic keys-a public key and a private key-for the secure transmission andauthentication of data across public networks.  Vendor systems do, however,differ (Key Recovery, Encryption-Authorization). ",0
Digital Watermark is a unique identifier being part of a digital document. The watermark is invisible to the human eye but a computer can analyze the document and extract the hidden data.  The watermark cannot beremoved. The primary use of such marks is to allow different marks to be used whenthe document is copied to different persons and thereby establish an AuditTrail should there be any leakage of information. ,0

The Disaster Recovery Plan is needed to make sure that when the disasterstrucks, people are being taken to safety quickly, or the further spread of aVirus or Trojan horse can be prevented.  Also, with the help of the BusinessContinuity Plan, systems can go online again immediately if need be or elsewithin the time frame planned and agreed upon beforehand ,",0
"Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack (DDoS) is a distributed version ofDoS.  Many hosts are used to send packets to a target host.  This way the hostis flooded by a high amount of traffic and similar results to DoS are achieved,. Administrators should check any systems connected to the internet frequently for the presence of DDoS software that could be used to attack othernetworks by following the steps as outlined in Table 8. Moreover, unnecessary ports should be closed.  For instance, during August 2003 MSBlaster took advantage of known vulnerable network ports inWindows, ports that should have been closed. ",0
"The Domain Name System (DNS) is the Internet's system for mapping alphabetic names to numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses like a phone book maps a person's name to a phone number.  For example, when a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser, a DNS query is made to learn an IP address of a Web server associated with that name. Using the www. example. com URL, example. com is the domain name, and www is the hostname.  DNS resolution maps www. example. com into an IP address (such as 192. 0. 2. 1).  When a user needs to load a webpage, a conversion must occur between what a user types into their web browser (www. example. com) into an IP address required to locate the www. example. com site. The DNS system is an open worldwide network of database name servers that include 13 authoritative name servers that serve the DNS root zone level, known as ""root servers"".  A root server (also called a DNS root nameserver) receives a DNS query that includes a domain name (e. g.  www. thousandeyes. com), and responds by directing that request to a top-level domain (TLD) nameserver, based on the TLD of that domain such as . com, . net, and . org.  It directly responds to requests for DNS records in the root zone by returning an appropriate list of the authoritative TLD name servers for the appropriate TLD that can resolve the initial DNS lookup request for an IP address of that domain name.

"A dynamic link library (DLL) is a collection of small programs that larger programs can load when needed to complete specific tasks.  The small program, called a DLL file, contains instructions that help the larger program handle what may not be a core function of the original program. An example of those tasks might be communicating with a specific device, such as a printer or scanner to process a document.  DLL files that support specific device operations are known as device drivers. DLL contains bits of code and data, like classes and variables, or other resources such as images that the larger program can use. In addition to being a generic term for dynamic link libraries, Dynamic Link Library is also the name of Microsoft's version of the shared library concept for Windows.  A shared library can exist in any operating system (OS). ",0
"e-Government is the public’s efforts to bring dealings with the governmentonline, thereby enabling citizens to conduct most of their businesses (e. g. ,ordering a passport) online.  Accordingly, while the UK wants every government transaction to be offered online by 2005, Denmark has chosen toprovide all of its citizens with digital signatures to enable them to do all theirtransactions online ,. Pushing e-Government initiatives requires satisfactory IT security of information, data and protection of people’s privacy which can be a challenge. For instance in 2002, Canada’s Auditor General released a report in which itstated that government sites do not seem to do well as far as privacy and datasecurity are concerned.  His 2003 report acknowledged some improvementsbut did not yet give e-Government sites a passing grade.  Quite likely, othergovernments may have to improve on this score as well. As Table 9 suggests, putting down a policy about e-government and ITinitiatives is important.  The hard work follows thereafter.  Providing everycitizen with a digital signature is a start but, without addressing the issuesin Table 9, it is unlikely to improve service for citizens.  Accordingly, governments will have to learn how to manage the changed relationships withtheir citizens and business thanks to e-government.  Also, Identity Theft maybecome an issue thanks to increased use of digital signatures by citizensinteracting with the government. ",0
"eMail or Electronic Mail is an electronically transmitted message which arrives as a computer file on a user’s PC or the corporation’s server.  Originallyconceived as a simple means of sending short messages from one computer toanother, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was introduced withoutsecurity in mind. Whilst standards have been agreed for the attachment of files to eMailmessages, be aware that such files can contain Malicious Code such as a Virus. eMail is insecure because:Message can purport to have been sent from an individual, whilst it was sentfrom somebody else, possible misrepresentation;The From field may have been modified to indicate a sender that is fallacious ordoes not exist;Because there is no Authentication, the eMail can be opened by anyone unlessit is encrypted ,;When sending eMail, the sender has no guarantee that the recipient has receivedit after passing through multiple computer nodes to get to the final destination, hence, without requesting safe receipt there is little guarantee ,; andeMail is not a legal document unless sent using a digital signature but by 2002,EU member states and the USA (some states) have begun accepting documents withDigital Signatures as legally binding documents",0
"Encryption is the process of conversion of an easily understood format (text)into another format apparently lacking sense because it is encoded.  Theencrypted text is called ciphertext ,. In the Encryption context, Algorithms use a key to control encryption anddecryption (See Algorithm), two categories are used:Symmetric (or Secret-key): Uses the same key for encryption & decryption, orthe latter key is easily derived from the encryption key ,. Asymmetric (or Public key): A different key is used for encrypting and decrypting a message; accordingly, the decrypting key cannot be derived from theencrypting key.  (See also Algorithms, Tables 11A and 11B). A majority of cryptographic products are software rather than hardwarebased.  Moreover, many are communications-oriented rather than data storageoriented; they heavily tend towards secure electronic mail, IP security (IPsec),and Virtual Private Network applications. In 1999 a report identified 805 hardware and / or software products incorporating cryptography manufactured in 35 countries outside the UnitedStates.  Most were manufactured in these countries in that order:United Kingdom, followed by Germany, Canada, Australia, Switzerland,Sweden, the Netherlands, and Israel. Other countries accounted for slightly more than a quarter of the world’stotal of encryption products.  Table 11A outlines some of the algorithms thathave been used based on the DES standard. Table 11B outlines the various standards that were submitted for testingand examination.  These finalists were part of the tests being undertaken toselect the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Rijndael",0

"Extensive Mark-up Language (XML) is the first building bloc for a Semantic Web.  Invisible to the human viewer, XML tags can be used to describehow information on a page is structured, allowing visiting computers to readand act on it without human invention.  XML describes data in terms of its content.  In that respect XML is a markuplanguage that has significant potential for the capture and onward processingof data directly from web pages.  The real significance of this is that Businessto Business data transfer is greatly facilitated by XML as neither party needs.  to write interfaces to each other’s systems; they merely need to be able toaccept and process XML.  Unlike Hyper Text Mark-up Language (HTML) which is a single predefined language‚ XML is a metalanguage.  Hence‚ it is a language for describing other languages.  Therefore‚ visiting computers need to be familiar with thespecific XML language before then can interpret the web page or document. Hence‚ a computer can refer to an XML “schema” located elsewhere on theweb. ",0
Extranet helps the organization to link the outside world such as suppliersand customers with a private intranet.  While this is similar to the internet‚access is controlled and restricted to particular groups‚ similar to the Intranet. Accordingly‚ an Extranet web server can be accessed by all the participantsinvolved in a project (e. g. ‚ various engineers and the firm developing a newproduct)‚ but not by anyone else.  In this example‚ the Extranet providesproject management functions for the work in progress and the work teamsinvolved.  The security is increased; however‚ breaches can still occur (e. g. ‚cyberpunk getting hold of a password or access to a server who‚ with apassword‚ is given access to the Extranet) ,0
Burden of Proof is the necessity or duty of affirmatively proving a factor facts in a dispute.  Hence‚ it is important to provide Reliable and Validevidence‚ especially if the victimized party (e. g. ‚ home user) wants to proofthat he or she has suffered damages through a computer virus.

"Firewall consists of a set of related programs‚ located at a network gateway server.  A firewall is a combination of hardware and software used toimplement a security policy governing the network traffic between two ormore networks.  Some of that traffic may be under the administrator’s control(e. g. ‚ organization’s networks) and some of which may be out of the systemadministrator’s control (e. g. ‚ the Internet). Firewalls determine whether to block or allow network traffic by lookingat TCP7IP packet headers to determine if these are in accordance with predetermined security policy.  However‚ a firewall does neither have the capabilityto recognize malicious code (Malware‚ Virus)‚ nor any means for preventingits transfer to a target system. A Firewall usually protects the resources of a private network from usersfrom other networks.  A network firewall commonly serves as a primary lineof defense against external threats to an organization’s computer systems‚networks‚ and critical information.  Firewalls can also be used to partition anorganization’s internal networks‚ reducing the risk from insider attacks. There are three types of firewalls:Pack Filter—filters the contents of the IP packet header‚ therefore‚ limited tothe source and destination address as well as the TCP/UDP port number.  Filterdoes not check content of message/data;Circuit Filter or Circuit Level Gateway—applies packet filtering but verifiesinformation based on TCP or UDP packet header information as well.  Hence‚it can make a better decision if the individual packets form part of a valid TCPsequence.  Creates a handshake‚ and once that takes place passes everythingthrough until the session is ended.  Still it has no knowledge of which user isrequesting access to services; andApplication Filter—uses proxies to apply filter rules based on the data contentand sometimes the user.  A dedicated program called a ‘proxy’ or ‘proxy server’is used to effect the application filter policy rules.  Commonly used applicationfilter is the web proxy.  It can be used to restrict the internal (or Intranet) webpages that are published out to the internet ,. ",0
Firmware often takes the form of a device which is attached to‚ or built into‚a computer‚ such as a ROM chip.  It performs some software function but isnot a program in the sense of being installed and run from the computer’sstorage media.  Hence‚ it is located in the middle of the conceptual continuumbetween hardware and software. ,0
Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is used to periodically verify the identity of the peer using a 3-way handshake.  This isdone upon initial link establishment‚ and MAY be repeated anytime after thelink has been established. After the Link Establishment phase is complete‚ the authenticator sendsa “challenge” message to the peer which is a random byte-sequence as wellas the identifier‚ a randomly generated number.  The peer responds with avalue calculated using a “one-way hash” function.  The authenticator checksthe response against its own calculation of the expected hash value.  If thevalues match‚ the authentication is acknowledged; otherwise the connectionSHOULD be terminated. CHAP provides protection against playback attack through the use of anincrementally changing identifier and a variable challenge value.  The use ofrepeated challenges is intended to limit the time of exposure to any singleattack.  The authentication can occur between client and server‚ in largerinfrastructures‚ however‚ the administration of keys or passwords can bequite a big effort. CHAP also supports the use of central server that acts as a central certification unit according to such as‚ the Remote Access Dial-in User Serviceprinciple or is in control of the frequency and timing of the challenges. ,0

Ubiquitous Computing is a term put forward by Mark Weiser in Ubiquitous Computing is a term put forward by Mark Weiser in 1988‚ describing it as information technology’s next wave after the mainframe and PC.  In this new world‚ what Weiser called “calm technology” will reside around us‚ interacting with users in natural ways to anticipate their needs and supply the information they want wherever they are.  Pervasive Computing requires that computing devices are ubiquitious and if not invisible‚ at least handy for users and easy to take wherever one wishes to go (e. g. ‚ small cellular used for tracking location of person).  PervasiveComputing envisions environments richly lathered with computation‚ communication and networked devices‚ mobile users interacting with their environment using speech and vision‚ with secure access to personal or publicdata.  Pervasive Computing environments will not simply be standalone vehicles for number crunching‚ rather they will immerse their users in a triad of nvisible computation‚ communication and devices‚ working in concert to satisfy userrequirements according to the facilities available in the environment. As such Pervasive Computing is a world saturated with computing andcommunication on the road to Ubiquitous Computing.  The latter also gracefully integrates social and end-user issues including but not limited to SocialInformatics and Social Securematics. ,0

This idea greatly simplifies management of authorizationwhile providing an opportunity for great flexibility in specifying and enforcing enterprise- specific protection policies.  Users can be made members ofroles as determined by their responsibilities and qualifications and can beeasily reassigned from one role to another without modifying the underlyingaccess structure.  Roles can be granted new permissions as new applicationsand actions are incorporated, and permissions can be revoked from roles asneeded. ",0

Signature Based Intrusion Detection Systems are matching collected dataagainst known set of signatures of known attacks.  This means that thesesystems are only as good as their patter/finger print/signature database. These databases have to be continuously updated and maintained to assure their currency.

Smurfing is an attack that exploits features of the IP protocol within theTCP/IP protocol used for internet communications.  A smurf attack causes a victim’s computer to become completely ‘waylaid’ with answering fictitious network requests (‘Pings’) that it grinds to ahalt and prevents anyone else from logging on.  ,0

"Social Engineering is a technique where persuasion and/or deception are usedto gain access to the systems.  This is typically implemented through humanconversation or other interaction.  Typical example of this is an attack wherea hacker pretends to be a high positioned IT executive traveling on companybusiness and having problems to connect to the organization’s informationsystem through its remote access point. The person may gradually succeed in persuading the Help Desk operatorto tell him or her all the necessary details for the connection set-up.  Later onattacker calls again, complaining that his password for some reason does notwork and persuades the Help Desk to change it to a password of her or hisliking.  Hence, the person may gain unauthorized access ,. The term can also be applied to exploiting the victim’s good intentions andlack of in-depth technical knowledge in order to inspire fear and confusion. This process is often considered in the context of ‘memetics’, which dealswith the transfer of memes (the ‘unit of cultural inheritance’) from brain tobrain. Where social engineering is linked to an IT security issue or hoax, it nearlyalways trades on technophobia ",0
"P2P Spoofing means that an attacker could have anonymously tricked aninnocent P2P user into downloading a contraband file from another user onthe P2P network.  This can occur by having an attacker modify search requestsand search results in transit by, for instance, placing the innocent user’s IPaddress in the search result packet that lists a contraband file.  Another waymight be whereby a search request for music has a hop count set to 255.  Theflawed P2P application permits the attacker to set the hop count value backto zero, thereby making the innocent user be seen as the originator.  Changingthe search string church hymns to Rolling Stones makes an authority assumethat the innocent user went out to search for illegal content. The difficulties for authorities is to prove that the apparent offender wasthe actual offender, in turn this would require that the agency proofs that therewere no malicious users on the P2P network at the time while the apparentoffender’s P2P application had no implementation flaws that are possible.

"Steganography (“hidden writing”) is a form of data hiding.  Unlike cryptography, which creates an unreadable version of a message for anyone withoutthe key, Steganography conceals even the existence of secret messages.  Oneof the earliest forms of Steganography is spread-spectrum radio transmissions, in which parts of a message (even parts of individual bits) are senton pseudo-randomly varying radio frequencies; without the right equipment,the signal is merely electronic white noise. Steganography circumvents restrictions on encryption and preventsSIGINT (signals intelligence) personnel from detecting encrypted traffic. Digital watermarks and copy-protection schemes are forms of Steganography used to reduce the ease of illegal copying of intellectual property and totrace the origin of files ,. There are many tools available for embedding secret messages in otherfiles; for instance, MP3STEGO modifies MP3 audio files to hold messages. Steganalysis tools look for tell-tale patterns in changed data when lookingfor concealed messages. ",0
"Stream Cipher encrypts in small units, often a bit or a byte at a time.  Unlike abasic block cipher, a stream cipher will have output corresponding to a giveninput will depend on where in the message it occurs.

"Just as the way business is organized and conducted has been profoundly changed by information and communications technology, the operation of government at all levels has been similarly affected.  The term e-government (or electronic government) is a way of looking at these changes as a whole and of considering how government uses (or might use) various computer applications. The use of information technology in government can involve changes in the organization and internal communications of government departments, changes in how services are delivered to the public, and providing new ways for the public to interact with the agency. Internally, government agencies have many of the same information management and sharing needs as private enterprises ,.  However, government agencies are likely to have to adapt their information systems to account for complex, specialized regulations (both those the agency administers and others it is subject to).  The standards of openness and accountability are generally different from and stricter than those that apply to private organizations. ",0
"Eiffel is an interesting programming language developed by Bertrand Meyer and his company Eiffel Software in the 1980s.  The language was named for Gustav Eiffel, the architect who designed the famous tower in Paris.  The language and accompanying methodology attracted considerable interest at software engineering conferences. Eiffel fully supports (and in some ways pioneered) programming concepts found in more widely used languages today ,.  Syntactically, Eiffel emphasizes simple, reusable declarations that make the program easier to understand, and tries to avoid obscure or lower-level code such as compiler optimizations. ",0
"Eiffel’s proponents note that it is more than a language: It is designed to provide consistent ways to revise and reuse program components throughout the software development cycle.  The current implementation of Eiffel is available for virtually all platforms and has interfaces to C, C++, and other languages.  This allows Eiffel to be used to create a design framework for reusing existing software components in other languages.  Eiffel’s consistent object-oriented design also makes it useful for documenting or modeling software projects",0
"There are a variety of ways to electronically register, store, and process votes.  In recent years older manual systems (paper ballots or mechanical voting machines) have been replaced in many areas with systems ranging from purely digital (touch screens) to hybrid systems where marked paper ballots are scanned and tabulated by machine.  However, voting systems have been subject to considerable controversy, particularly following the Florida debacle in the 2000 U. S.  presidential election. The criteria by which voting systems are evaluated include:, how easy it is for the voter to understand and use the system, accessibility for disabled persons, whether the voter’s intentions are accurately recorded , the ability to make a permanent record of the vote, prevention of tampering (physical or electronic), provisions for independent auditing of the votes in case of disputeThe degree to which a given system meets these criteria can vary considerably because of both design and implementation issues. ",0
"The earliest form of voting system consisted of paper ballots marked and tabulated entirely by hand.  The first generation of “automatic” voting systems involved mechanical voting machines (where votes were registered by pulling levers).  Next came two types of hybrid systems where votes were cast mechanically but tabulated automatically.  These systems used punch cards , or “marksense” or similar systems where the voter filled in little squares and the ballots were then scanned and tabulated automatically. The ultraclose and highly disputed 2000 U. S.  presidential election “stress-tested” voting systems that most people had previously believed were reasonably accurate.  The principal problems were the interpretation of punch cards that were not properly punched through (so-called dimpled or hanging chads) and the fact that some ballot layouts proved to be confusing or ambiguous.  Two types of voting systems have been proposed as replacements for the problematic earlier technology",0
"This type of system uses a screen display that can be directly manipulated by the voter ,.  In the most common type, called DRE (direct-recording electronic), a computer program interprets and tabulates the vote as it is cast, storing an image in a removable memory unit and (usually) printing out a copy for backup.  After voting is complete, the memory module can be sent to the central counting office.  (Alternatively, votes can be transmitted over a computer network in batches throughout the day. ) In a few cases, voting has also been implemented through secure Internet sites. ",0
"Concern about potential tampering with computers has led many jurisdictions to begin to replace touchscreen systems with optical-scan systems, where the voter marks a sturdy paper ballot.  (About half of U. S.  counties now use optical-scan systems. ) The advantage of optical systems is that the voter physically marks the ballot and can see how he or she has voted, and after tabulation the physical ballots are available for review in case of problems.  However, optical-scan ballots must be properly marked using the correct type of pencil, or they may not be read correctly.  Unlike the touchscreen, it is not possible to give the voter immediate feedback so that any errors can be corrected.  Optical-ballot systems may cost more because of paper and printing costs for the ballots, which may have to be prepared in several languages.  However this cost may be offset by not having to develop or validate the more complicated software needed for all-electronic systems. ",0
"Electronic mail is perhaps the most ubiquitous computer application in use today.  E-mail can be defined as the sending of a message to one or more individuals via a computer system, open the file, and look for messages.  In 1971, however, the ARPANET (ancestor of the Internet—see internet) was used by researchers at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) to send messages from a user at one computer to a user at another.  The availability of e-mail helped fuel the growth of the ARPANET through the 1970s and beyond. connection. Development and ArchitectureThe simplest form of e-mail began in the 1960s as a way that users on a time-sharing computer system could post and read messages.  The messages consisted of text in a file that was accessible to all users.  A user could simply log into the",0
"When people think of a computer, they generally think of a general-purpose computing system housed in a separate box, for use on the desk or as a laptop or hand-held device.  However, the personal computer and its cousins are only the surface of a hidden web of computing capability that reaches deep into numerous devices used in our daily lives.  Modern cars, for example, often contain several specialized computer systems that monitor fuel injection or enhance the car’s grip on the road under changing conditions.  Many kitchen appliances such as microwaves, dishwashers, and even toasters contain their own computer chips.  Communications systems ranging from cell phones to TV satellite dishes include embedded computers.  Most important, embedded systems are now essential to the operation of critical infrastructure such as medical monitoring systems and power transmission networks.  (The potential vulnerability of embedded systems to the Y2K date-related problems was a major concern in the months leading up to 2000, especially because many embedded systems might have to be replaced rather than just reprogrammed.  In the event, it turned out that there were relatively few date-dependent systems and only minor disruptions were experienced",0
"One consequence of the universal computer concept , is that in principle any computer can be programmed to imitate the operation of any other.  An emulator is a program that runs on one computer but accurately processes instructions written for another ,.  For example, fans of older computer games can now download emulation programs that allow modern PCs to run games originally intended for an Apple II microcomputer or an Atari game machine.  Emulators allowing Macintosh and Linux users to run Windows programs have also achieved some success. In order to work properly, the emulator must set up a sort of virtual model of the target microprocessor, including appropriate registers to hold data and instructions and a suitably organized segment of memory.  While carrying out instructions in software rather than in hardware imposes a considerable speed penalty, if the processor of the emulating PC is much faster than the one being emulated, the emulator can actually run faster than the original machine. ",0
"In the earliest programming languages, any part of a program could access any other part simply by executing an instruction such as “jump” or “goto. ” Later, the concept of the subroutine helped impose some order by creating relatively self-contained routines that could be “called” from the main program.  At the time the subroutine is called, it is provided with necessary data in the form of global variables or (preferably) parameters, which are variable references or values passed explicitly when the subroutine is called.  When the subroutine finishes processing, it may return values by changing global variables or changing the values of variables that were passed as parameters",0
"The use of encryption to disguise the meanings of messages goes back thousands of years (the Romans, for example, used substitution ciphers, where each letter in a message was replaced with a different letter).  Mechanical cipher machines first came into general use in the 1930s.  During World War II the German Enigma cipher machine used multiple rotors and a configurable plugboard to create a continuously varying cipher that was thought to be unbreakable.  However, Allied codebreakers built electromechanical and electronic devices that succeeded in exploiting flaws in the German machine (while incidentally advancing computing technology).  During the cold war Western and Soviet cryptographers vied to create increasingly complex cryptosystems while deploying more powerful computers to decrypt their opponent’s messages. ",0
"This concept refers to the organization of data processing and communications across an entire corporation or other organization.  Historically, computing technology and infrastructure often developed at different rates in the various departments of a corporation.  For example, by the 1970s, departments such as payroll and accounting were making heavy use of electronic data processing (EDP) using mainframe computers.  The introduction of the desktop computer in the 1980s often resulted in operations such as marketing, corporate communications, and planning being conducted using a disparate assortment of software, databases, and document repositories.  Even the growing use of networking often meant that an enterprise had several different networks with at best rudimentary intercommunication",0
"Much publicity has been given to figures such as Microsoft founder and multibillionaire Bill Gates, who turned a vest-pocket company selling BASIC language tapes into the dominant seller of operating systems and office software for PCs.  Historically, however, the role of key entrepreneurs in the establishment of information technology sectors repeats the achievements of such 19th- and early 20th-century technology pioneers as Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.  There appear to be certain times when scientific insight and technological capability can be translated into businesses that have the potential to transform society while making the pioneers wealthy",0
"Ergonomics is the study of the “fit” between people and their working environment.  Because computers are such a significant part of the working life of so many people, finding ways for people to maximize efficiency and reduce health risks associated with computer use is increasingly important. Since the user will be looking at the computer monitor for hours on end, it is important that the display be large enough to be comfortably readable and that there be enough contrast.  Glare on the monitor surface should be avoided.  It is recommended that the monitor be placed so that the top line of text is slightly below eye level.  A distance of about 18 inches to two feet (roughly arm’s length) is recommended.  There has been concern about the health effects of electromagnetic radiation generated by monitors.  Most new monitors are designed to have lower emissions",0
"Transmitting data involves the sending of bits (ones and zeros) as signaled by some alternation in physical characteristics (such as voltage or frequency).  There are a number of ways in which errors can be introduced into the data stream.  For example, electrical “noise” in the line might be interpreted as spurious bits, or a bit might be “flipped” from one to zero or vice versa.  Generally speaking, the faster the rates at which bits are being sent, the more sensitive the transmission is to effects that can cause errors. While a few wrong characters might be tolerated in some text messages or graphics files, binary files representing executable programs must generally be received perfectly, since random changes can make programs fail or produce incorrect results.  Data communications engineers have devised a number of methods for checking the accuracy of data transmissions",0
"An important characteristic of quality software is its ability to handle errors that arise in processing (also called run-time errors or “exceptions”).  Before it is released for general use, a program should be thoroughly tested with a variety of input ,.  When errors are found, the soundness of the algorithm and its implementation must be checked, as well as the program logic ,.  Interaction between the program and other programs (including the operating system) as well as with hardware must also be considered.  (See bugsand debugging. )However, even well-tested software is likely to encounter errors.  Therefore a program intended for widespread use must include instructions for dealing with errors, anticipated or otherwise.  The process of error handling can be divided into four stages: validation, detection, communication, and amelioration. ",0
"An expert system is a computer program that uses encoded knowledge and rules of reasoning to draw conclusions or solve problems.  Since reasoning (as opposed to mechanical calculation) is a form of intelligent behavior, the field of expert systems (also called knowledge representation or knowledge engineering) is part of the broader field of AI",0
"An expert system has two main components, a knowledge baseand an inference engine.  The knowledge base consists of a set of assertions (facts) or of rules expressed as if .  .  .  then statements that specify conditions that, if true, allow a particular inference to be drawn ,.  The inference engine accepts new assertions or queries and tests them against the stored rules.  Because satisfying one rule can create a condition that is to be tested by a subsequent rule, chains of reasoning can be built up.  If the reasoning is from initial facts to an ultimate conclusion, it is called forward chaining.  If a conclusion is given and the goal is to prove that conclusion, there can be backward chaining from the conclusion to the assertions",0
"Today the term data is associated in many peoples’ minds mainly with computers.  However, data (as in “given facts” or measurements) has been used as a term by scientists and scholars for centuries.  Just as with a counting bead, a notch in a stick, or a handwritten tally, data as stored in a computer (or on digital media) is a representation of facts about the world.  These facts might be temperature readings, customer addresses, dots in an image, the characteristics of a sound at a given instant, or any number of other things.  But because computer data is not a fact but a representation of facts, its accuracy and usefulness depends not only on the accuracy of the original data, but on its context in the computer",0
"Abstract data types are used to describe a “generic” type of data, specifying how the data is stored and what operations can be performed on it ,. DFor example, an abstract stack data type includes a structure for storing data (such as a list or array) and a set of operations, such as “pushing” an integer onto the stack and “popping” (removing) an integer from the stack.  (For the process of combining data and operations into a single entity, see encapsulation. ) Abstract data types can be implemented directly in object-oriented programming languages",0
"One advantage of using abstract data types is that it separates a structure and functionality from its implementation.  In designing the abstract stack type, for example, one can focus on what a stack does and its essential functions.  One avoids becoming immediately bogged down with details, such as what sorts of data items can be placed on the stack, or exactly what mechanism will be used to keep track of the number of items currently stored.  This approach also avoids “featuritis,” the tendency to see how many possible functions or features one can add to the stack object.  For example, while it might be useful to give a stack the ability to print out a list of its items, it is probably better to wait until one needs such a capability than to burden the basic stack idea with extra baggage that may make it more cumbersome or less efficient. An abstract data type or its embodiment",0
"There are a variety of ways in which data (facts or measurements about the world) can be turned into a digital representation suitable for manipulation by a computer.  For example, pressing a key on the keyboard sends a signal that is stored in a memory buffer using a value that represents the ASCII character code for the key pressed.  Moving the mouse sends a stream of signals that are proportional to the rotation of the ball which in turn is calibrated into a series of coordinates and ultimately to a position on the screen where the cursor is to be moved.  Digital cameras and scanners convert the varying light levels of what they “see” into a digital image",0
"The data acquisition system begins with a transducer, which is a device that converts a physical phenomenon (such as heat) into a proportional electrical signal.  Transducers include devices such as thermistors, thermocouples, and pressure or strain gauges.  The output of the transducer is then fed into a signal conditioning circuit.  The purpose of signal conditioning is to make sure the signal fits into the range needed by the data processing device.  Thus the signal may be amplified or its voltage may be adjusted or scaled to the required level.  Another function of signal conditioning is to isolate the incoming signal from the computer to which the acquisition device is connected.  This is necessary both to protect the delicate computer circuits from possible “spikes” in the incoming signal and to prevent “noise” (extraneous electromagnetic signals created by the computer itself) from distorting the signal, and thus the ultimate measurements.  Various sorts of filters can be added for this purpose. ",0
"Data acquisition systems are essential to gathering and processing the detailed data required by scientific and engineering applications.  The automated control of chemical or biochemical processes requires the ability of the control software to assess real-time physical data in order to make timely adjustments to such factors as temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts, inhibitors, or other components of the process.  The highly automated systems used in modern aviation and increasingly, even in ground vehicles, depend on real-time data acquisition.  It is not surprising, then, that data acquisition is one of the fastest-growing fields in computing",0
"Database administration is the management of database systems ,.  Database administration can be divided into four broad areas: data security, data integrity, data accessibility, and system development. ",0
"With regard to databases, ensuring data security includes the assignment and control of users’ level of access to sensitive data and the use of monitoring tools to detect compromise, diversion, or unauthorized changes to database files ,.  When data is proprietary, licensing agreements with both database vendors and content providers may also need to be enforced. ",0
"Data integrity is related to data security, since the completeness and accuracy of data that has been compromised can no longer be guaranteed.  However, data integrity also requires the development and testing of procedures for the entry and verification of data (input) as well as verifying the accuracy of reports (output).  Database administrators may do some programming, but generally work with the programming staff in maintaining data integrity.  Since most data in computers ultimately comes from human beings, the training of operators is also important. Within the database structure itself, the links between data fields must be maintained (referential integrity) and a locking system must be employed to ensure that a new update is not processed while a pending one is incomplete ,. Internal procedures and external regulations may require that a database be periodically audited for accuracy.  While this may be the province of a specially trained information processing auditor, it is often added to the duties of the database administrator",0
"Accessibility has two aspects.  First, the system must be reliable.  Data must be available whenever needed by the organization, and in many applications such as e-commerce, this means 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7).  Reliability requires making the system as robust as possible, such as by “mirroring” the database on multiple servers (which in turn requires making sure updates are stored concurrently).  Failure must also be planned for, which means the imple-130? ? ? ? database administrationmentation of onsite and offsite backups and procedures for restoring data ",0
"A database management system consists of a database (a collection of information, usually organized into records with component fields) and facilities for adding, updating, retrieving, manipulating, and reporting on data. ",0
"Broadly speaking, data communications is the transfer of data between computers and their users.  At its most abstract level, data communications requires two or more computers, a device to turn data into electronic signals (and back again), and a transmission medium.  Telephone lines, fiber optic cable, network (Ethernet) cable, video cable, radio (wireless), or other kinds of links can be used.  Finally, there must be software that can manage the flow of data",0
"Data communications are the basis both for networks and for the proper functioning of servers that provide services such as World Wide Web pages, electronic mail, online databases, and multimedia content (such as audio and streaming video).  While Web page design and e-commerce are the “bright lights” that give cyberspace its character, data communications are like the plumbing without which computers cannot work together.  The growing demand for data communications, particularly broadband services such as DSL and cable modems, translates into a steady demand for engineers and technicians specializing in the maintenance and growth of this infrastructure ,. ",0
"The process of removing redundant information from data so that it takes up less space is called data compression.  Besides saving disk space, compressing data such as e-mail attachments can make data communications faster. Compression methods generally begin with the realization that not all characters are found in equal numbers in text.  For example, in English, letters such as e and s are found much more frequently than letters such as j or x. By assigning the shortest bit codes to the most common characters and the longer codes to the least common characters, the number of bits needed to encode the text can be minimized",0
"The developer of each application program that writes data files must define a format for the data.  The format must be able to preserve all the features that are supported by the program.  For example, a word processing program will include special codes for font selection, typestyles (such as bold or italic), margin settings, and so on. In most markets there are more than one vendor, so there is the potential for users to encounter the need to convert files such as word processing documents from one vendor’s format to another.  For example, a Microsoft Word user needing to send a document to a user who has WordPerfect, or the user may encounter another user who also has Microsoft Word, but a later version. ",0
"A modern enterprise database system can contain hundreds of separate data items, each with important characteristics such as field types and lengths, rules for validating the data, and links to various databases that use that item ,.  There can also be many different views or ways of organizing subsets of the data, and stored procedures (program code modules) used to perform various data processing functions.  A developer who is creating or modifying applications that deal with such a vast database will often need to check on the relationships between data elements, views, procedures, and other aspects of the system",0
"The process of analyzing existing databases in order to find useful information is called data mining.  Generally, a database, whether scientific or commercial, is designed for a data mining? ? ? ? 135particular purpose, such as recording scientific observations or keeping track of customers’ account histories.  However, data often has potential applications beyond those conceived by its collector",0
"A data structure is a way of organizing data for use in a computer program.  There are three basic components to a data structure: a set of suitable basic data types, a way to organize or relate these data items to one another, and a set of operations, or ways to manipulate the data. For example, the array is a data structure that can consist of just about any of the basic data types, although all data must be of the same type.  The way the data is organized is by storing it in sequentially addressable locations.  The operations include storing a data item (element) in the array and retrieving a data item from the array. ",0
"The data structures commonly used in computer science include arrays (as discussed above) and various types of lists.  The primary difference between an array and a list is that an array has no internal links between its elements, data structures? ? ? ? 137while a list has one or more pointers that link the elements.  There are several types of specialized list.  A tree is a list that has a root (an element with no predecessor), and each other element has a unique predecessor.  The guarantee of a unique path to each tree node can make the operations of inserting or deleting an item faster.  A stack is a list that is accessible only at the top (or front).  Any new item is inserted (“pushed”) on top of the last item, and removing (“popping”) an item always removes the item that was last inserted.  This order of access is called LIFO (last in, first out).  A list can also be organized in a first in, first out (FIFO) order.  This type of list is called a queue, and is useful in a situation where tasks must “wait their turn” for attention",0
"The preceding data types all hold single values.  However, most modern languages allow for the construction of data types that can hold more than one piece of data.  The arrayis the most basic structured data type; it represents a series of memory locations that hold data of one of the basic types.  Thus, in Pascal an array of integer holds integers, each taking up two bytes of memory. Many languages have composite data types that can hold data of several different basic types.  For example, the struct in C or the record in Pascal can hold data such as a person’s first and last name, three lines of address (all arrays of characters, or strings), an employee number (perhaps an integer or double), a Boolean field representing the presence or absence of some status, and so on.  This kind of data type is also called a user-defined data type because programmers can define and use these types in almost the same ways as they use the language’s built-in basic types. What is the difference between data types and data structures? There is no hard-and-fast distinction.  Generally, data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees are more complex than simple data types, because they include data relationships and special functions (such as pushing or popping data on a stack).  However, a list is the fundamental data type in list-processing languages such as Lisp, and string operators are built into languages such as Snobol.  (See list processing, stack, queue, and tree. )Further, in many modern languages fundamental and structured data types are combined seamlessly into classes that combine data structures with the relevant operations ,",0
"data warehouseModern business organizations create and store a tremendous amount of data in the form of transactions that become database records.  Increasingly, however, businesses are relying on their ability to use data that was collected for one purpose (such as sales, customer service, and inventory) for purposes of marketing research, planning, or decision support.  For example, transaction data might be revisited with a view to identifying the common characteristics of the firm’s best customers or determining the best way to market a particular type of product.  In order to conduct such research or analysis, the data collected in the course of business must be stored in such a way that it is both accurate and flexible in terms of the number of different ways in which it can be queried.  The idea of the data warehouse is to provide such a repository for data",0
"A decision support system (DSS) is a computer application that focuses on providing access to or analysis of the key information needed to make decisions, particularly in business.  (It can be thought of as a more narrowly focused approach to computer assistance to management—see management information system. )The development of DSS has several roots reaching back to the 1950s.  This includes operational analysis and the theory of organizations and the development of the first interactive (rather than batch-processing) computer systems.  Indeed, the SAGE automated air defense system developed starting in the 1950s could be described as a military DSS.  The system presented real-time information (radar plots) and enabled the operator to select and focus on particular elements using a light pen.  By the 1960s more-systematic research on DSS was underway and included the provocative idea of “human-computer symbiosis” for problem solving ,. ",0
"Dell Computer (NASDAQ: DELL) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers and sellers of desktop and laptop computers ,.  By 2008 Dell had more than 88,000 employees worldwide. The company was founded by Michael Dell, a student at the University of Texas at Austin whose first company was PC’s Limited, founded in 1984.  Even at this early stage Dell successfully employed several practices that would come to typify the Dell strategy: Sell directly to customers (not through stores), build each machine to suit the customer’s preferences, and be aggressive in competing on price. In 1988 the growing company changed its name to Dell Computer Corporation.  In the early 1990s Dell tried an alternative business model, selling through warehouse clubs and computer superstores.  When that met with little success, Dell returned to the original formula.  In 1999 Dell overtook Compaq to become the biggest computer retailer in America. ",0
"The unusual computing term demon (sometimes spelled daemon) refers to a process (program) that runs in the background, checking for and responding to certain events.  The utility of this concept is that it allows for automation of information processing without requiring that an operator initiate or manage the process. For example, a print spooler demon looks for jobs that are queued for printing, and deals with the negotiations necessary to maintain the flow of data to that device.  Another demon (called chron in UNIX systems) reads a file describing processes that are designated to run at particular dates or times.  For example, it may launch a backup utility every morning at 1:00 a. m.  E-mail also depends on the periodic operation of “mailer demons. ”",0
"Design patterns are an attempt to abstract and generalize what is learned in solving one problem so that it can be applied to future similar problems.  The idea was first applied to architecture by Christopher Alexander in his book A Pattern Language.  Alexander described a pattern as a description of situations in which a particular problem occurs, with a solution that takes into account the factors that are “invariant” (not changed by context).  Guidance for applying the solution is also provided. For example, a bus stop, a waiting room, and a line at a theme park are all places where people wait.  A “place to wait” pattern would specify the problem to be solved (how to make waiting as pleasant as possible) and suggest solutions.  Patterns can have different levels of abstraction or scales on which they apply (for example, an intimate theater and a stadium are both places of entertainment, but one is much larger than the other). Patterns in turn are linked into a network called a pattern language.  Thus when working with one pattern, the designer is guided to consider related patterns.  For example, a pattern for a room might relate to patterns for seating or grouping the occupants. ",0
"The concept of patterns and pattern languages carries over well into software design.  As with architectural patterns, a software pattern describes a problem and solution, along with relevant structures ,.  Note that patterns are not executable code; they are at a higher level (one might say abstract enough to be generalizable, specific enough to be applicable). Software patterns can specify how objects are created and ways in which they function and interface with other objects.  Patterns are generally documented using a common format",0
"Traditionally documents such as advertisements, brochures, and reports were prepared by combining typed or printed text with pasted-in illustrations (such as photographs and diagrams).  This painstaking layout process was necessary in order to produce “camera-ready copy” from which a printing company could produce the final product. Starting in the late 1980s, desktop computers became powerful enough to run software that could be used to create page layouts.  In addition, display hardware gained a high enough resolution to allow for pages to be shown on the screen in much the same form as they would appear on the printed page.  (This is known by the acronym WYSIWYG, or “what you see is what you get. ”) The final ingredient for the creation of desktop publishing was the advent of affordable laser or inkjet printers that could print near print quality text and high-resolution graphics",0
"A fundamental problem in computer design is the control of devices such as disk drives and printers.  Each device is designed to respond to a particular set of control commands sent as patterns of binary values through the port to which the device is connected.  For example, a printer will respond to a “new page” command by skipping lines to the end of the current page and moving the print head to the start of the next page, taking margin settings into account.  The problem is this: When an applications program such as a word processor needs to print a document, how should the necessary commands be provided to the printer? If every application program has to include the appropriate set of commands for each device that might be in use, programs will be bloated and much development effort will be required for supporting devices rather than extending the functionality of the product itself.  Instead, the manufacturers of printers and other devices such as scanners and graphics tablets typically provide a program called a driver.  (A version of the driver is created for each major operating system in use. ) The driver serves as the intermediary between the application, the operating system and the low-level device control system.  It is sometimes useful to have drivers in the form of continually running programs that monitor the status of a device and wait for commands. ",0
"Also called digital money or e-cash, digital cash represents the attempt to create a method of payment for online transactions that is as easy to use as the familiar bills and coins in daily commerce ,.  At present, credit cards are the principal means of making online payments.  While using credit cards takes advantage of a well-established infrastructure, it has some disadvantages.  From a security standpoint, each payment potentially exposes the payer to the possibility that the credit card number and possibly other identifying information will be diverted and used for fraudulent transactions and identity theft.  While the use of secure (encrypted) online sites has reduced this risk, it cannot be eliminated entirely ,.  Credit cards are also impracticable for very small payments from cents to a few dollars (such as for access to magazine articles) because the fees charged by the credit card companies would be too high in relation to the value of the transaction. ",0
"The concept of digital convergence is an attempt to explore the implications of so many formerly disparate analog media now being available in digital form.  All forms of digital media have key features in common.  First, they are essentially pure information (computer data).  This means that regardless of whether the data originally represented still images from a camera, video, or film, the sound of a human voice, music, or some other form of expression, that data can be stored, manipulated, and retrieved under the control of computer algorithms.  This makes it easier to create seamless multimedia presentations ,.  Services or products previously considered to be separate can be combined in new ways. ",0
"The dashboard of a car is designed to present vital real-time information to the driver, such as speed, fuel supply, and engine status.  Ideally this information should be easy to grasp at a glance, allowing for prompt action when necessary.  Conversely, unnecessary and potentially distracting information should be avoided, or at least relegated to an unobtrusive secondary display. A digital dashboard is a computer display that uses similar concepts.  Its goal is to provide an executive or manager with the key information that allows him or her to monitor the health of the enterprise and to take action when necessary.  (A digital dashboard can also be part of a larger set of management tools—see decision support system. ",0
"The term digital divide was coined in the late 1990s amid growing concern that groups such as minorities, the elderly, and rural residents were not becoming computer literate and connecting to the Internet at the same rate as the young, educated, and relatively affluent. Nearly a decade later this perception of a chasm has diminished somewhat.  According to the Pew Internet & American Life project, as of 2006 about two-thirds (70 per-148? ? ? ? digital dashboardcent) of American adults were using the Internet, and the number has continued to increase, though more slowly (there is evidence of a “hard core” unconnected population).  Groups that lagged in Internet usage included Americans 65 years or older (35 percent), African Americans (58 percent), and persons without at least a high school education (36 percent). ",0
"By default, once information is digitized it is simply a pattern of bits that can be easily copied within the same or a different medium, using a variety of software or the built-in facilities of the operating system.  Of course the development of tape-recording technology in the mid-20th century already made it possible to copy audio recordings, and the later development of videotape and the VCR did the same for video.  However, while analog copying techniques lose some accuracy (or fidelity) with each generation of copying, digital files can be copied exactly each time.  It is equally easy to e-mail, upload, or otherwise distribute audio or video files. Legally, the creator of an original work can assert copyright—literally, the “right to copy” or to control when and how the work is distributed.  Digital rights management (DRM) refers to a variety of technologies that can be used to enforce this right by making it at least difficult for the purchaser of one copy of a work to copy and distribute it in turn.  (Similar technologies have also been used to prevent copying of software, which is, after all, just another pattern of bits—see copy protection and software piracy andcounterfeiting. )",0
"This concept involves the creation of a software system that runs programs and stores data across a number of different computers, an idea pervasive today.  A simple form is the central computer (such as in a bank or credit card company) with which thousands of terminals communicate to submit transactions.  While this system is in some sense distributed, it is not really decentralized.  Most of the work is done by the central computer, which is not dependent on the terminals for its own functioning.  However, responsibilities can be more evenly apportioned between computers ,. ",0
"Distributed computing is particularly suited to applications that require extensive computing resources and that may need to be scaled (smoothly enlarged) to accommodate increasing needs ,.  Examples might include large databases, intensive scientific computing, and cryptography.  A particularly interesting example is SETI@home, which invites computer users to install a special screen saver that runs a distributed process during the computer’s idle time.  The process analyzes radio telescope data for correlations that might indicate receipt of signals from an extraterrestrial intelligence ,. Besides being able to marshal very large amounts of computing power, distributed systems offer improved fault tolerance.  Because the system is decentralized, if a particular computer fails, its processes can be replaced by ones running on other machines.  Replication (copying) of data across a widely dispersed network can also provide improved data recovery in the event of a disaster",0
"The operation of the Internet requires that each participating computer have a unique address to which data packets can be routed ,.  The Domain Name System (DNS) provides alphabetical equivalents to the numeric IP addresses, giving the now familiar-looking Web addresses (URLs), e-mail addresses, and so on. The system uses a set of “top-level” domains to categorize these names.  One set of domains is based on the nature of the sites involved, including: . com (commercial, corporate), . edu (educational institutions), . gov (government), . mil (military), . org (nonprofit organizations), . int (international organizations), . net (network service providers, and so on). The other set of top-level domains is based on the geographical location of the site.  For example, . au (Australia), . fr (France), and . ca (Canada).  (While the United States has the . us domain, it is generally omitted in practice, because the Internet was developed in the United States)",0
"The Document Object Model (DOM) is a way to represent a Web document , as an object that can be manipulated using code in a scripting language ,.  The DOM was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a way to standardize methods of manipulating Web pages at a time when different browsers used different access models.  The full specification is divided into four levels (0 through 3).  By 2005, most DOMspecifications were supported by the major Web browsers. Using DOM, a programmer can navigate through the hierarchical structure of a document, following links or “descending” into forms and user-interface objects.  With DOM one can also add HTML or XML elements, as well as load, save, or format documents. ",0
"DSL (digital subscriber line) is one of the two most prevalent forms of high-speed wired access to the Internet ,.  DSL can operate over regular phone lines (sometimes called POTS or “plain old telephone service”).  DSL takes advantage of the fact that existing phone lines can carry frequencies far beyond the narrow band used for voice telephony.  When installing DSL, the phone company must evaluate the quality of existing lines to determine how many frequency bands are usable, and thus how much data can be transmitted.  Further, because the higher the frequency the shorter the distance the signal can travel, the available bandwidth drops as one gets farther from the central office or a local DSL access Multiplexer (DSLAM)",0
"A digital video recorder (DVR) records digital television broadcasts and stores them on a disk ,.  DVRs first appeared as commercial products in 1999 in Replay TV and TiVo, the latter becoming the most successful player in the field. A DVR works with digital signals and discs rather than tape used by the video cassette recorders (VCRs) that had become popular starting in the 1980s.  The digital recorder has several advantages over tape:, much larger capacity, limited only by hard drive size, instant (random) access to any recorded programming without having to go forward or backward through a tape, the ability to “time shift” within a live broadcast, including pausing and instant replay, the ability to skip over commercials, digital special effects",0
"The C programming language was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, who based it on the earlier languages BCPL and B.  C was first used on DEC PDP-11 computers running the newly developed UNIX operating system, where the language provided a high-level alternative to the use of PDP Assembly language for development of the many utilities that give UNIX its flexibility.  Since the 1980s, C and its descendent, C++, have become the most widely used programming languages. ",0
"Introduced in 2002, C# (pronounced “C sharp”) is a programming language similar to C++ and Java but simplified in several respects and tailored for use with Microsoft’s latest programming platform ,.  C# is a general-purpose language and is thoroughly objectoriented—all functions must be declared as members of a class or “struct,” and even fundamental data types are derived from the System. Object class ,. Compared with C++, C# is stricter about the use and conversion of data types, not allowing most implicit conversions (such as from an enumeration type to the corresponding integer—see data structures).  Unlike C++, C# does not permit multiple inheritance (where a type can be derived from two or more base types), thereby avoiding an added layer of complexity in class relationships in large software projects.  (However, a similar effect can be obtained by declaring multiple “interfaces” or specified ways of accessing the same class. )Unlike Java (but like C++), C# includes pointers (and a safer version called “delegates”), enumerations (enum types), structs (treated as lightweight classes), and overloading (multiple definitions for operators).  The latest version of the language, C# 3. 0 (introduced in 2007), provides additional features for list processing and functional programming ,",0
"The C++ language was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T’s Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, starting in 1979.  By that time the C language had become well established as a powerful tool for systems programming ,.  However Stroustrup (and others) believed that C’s limited data structures and function mechanism were proving inadequate to express the relationships found in increasingly large software packages involving many objects with complex relationships. ",0
"During the late 1980s and 1990s, C++ became a very popular language for a variety of applications ranging from systems programming to business applications and games.  The growth of the language coincided with the development of more powerful desktop computers and the release of inexpensive, easy-to-use but powerful development environments from Microsoft, Borland, and others.  Since these compilers could also handle traditional C code, programmers could “port” existing code and use the object-oriented techniques of C++ as they mastered them.  By the late 1990s, however, C++, although still dominant in many areas, was being challenged by Java, a language that simplified some of the more complex features of C++ and that was designed 68? ? ? ? C++particularly for writing software to run on Web servers and browsers ,.  For an alternative approach to creating a somewhat more “streamlined” C-type language, ",0
A basic problem in computer design is how to optimize the fetching of instructions or data so that it will be ready when the processor (CPU) needs it.  One common solution is to use a cache.  A cache is an area of relatively fast-access memory into which data can be stored in anticipation of its being needed for processing.  Caches are used mainly in two contexts: the processor cache and the disk cache,0
"The use of a processor cache is advantageous because instructions and data can be fetched more quickly from the cache (static memory chips next to or within the CPU) than they can be retrieved from the main memory (usually dynamic RAM).  An algorithm analyzes the instructions currently being executed by the processor and tries to anticipate what instructions and data are likely to be needed in the near future.  (For example, if the instructions call for a possible branch to one of two sets of instructions, the cache will load the set that has been used most often or most recently.  Since many programs loop over and over again through the same instructions until some condition is met, the cache’s prediction will be right most of the time. )",0
"A disk cache uses the same general principle as a processor cache.  Here, however, it is RAM (either a part of main memory or separate memory on the disk drive) that is the faster medium and the disk drive itself that is slower.  When an application starts to request data from the disk, the cache reads one or more complete blocks or sectors of data from the disk rather than just the data record being requested.  Then, if the application continues to request sequential data records, these can be read from the high-speed memory on the cache rather than from the disk drive.  It follows that disk caching is most effective when an application, for example, loads a database file that is stored sequentially on the disk",0
"Caching techniques can be used in other ways.  For example, most Web browsers are set to store recently read pages on disk so that if the user directs the browser to go back to such a page it can be read from disk rather than having to be retransmitted over the Internet (generally a slower process).  Web servers and ISPs (such as cable services) can also cache popular pages so they can be served up quickly",0
"The final stage in the development of the calculator would be characterized by the use of electronics to replace mechanical (or electromechanical) action.  The use of logic 70? ? ? ? calculatorcircuits to perform calculations electronically was first seen in the giant computers of the late 1940s, but this was obviously impractical for desktop office use.  By the late 1960s, however, transistorized calculators comparable in size to mechanical desktop calculators came into use.  By the 1970s, the use of integrated circuits made it possible to shrink the calculator down to palm-size and smaller.  These calculators use a microprocessor with a set of “microinstructions” that enable them to perform a repertoire of operations ranging from basic arithmetic to trigonometric, statistical, or business-related function",0
"Development of automotive technology has tended to be incremental rather than revolutionary.  The core “hardware” such as the engine and drive train has changed little over several decades, other than the replacement of carburetors with fuel injection systems, and some improvements in areas such as brake design.  On the other hand there have been significant improvements in safety features such as seat belts, air bags, and improved crash absorption barriers. In recent years, however, the incorporation of computers in automobile design , has led to a number of significant advances in areas such as fuel efficiency, traction/stability, crash response, and driver information and navigation.  Put simply, cars are becoming “smarter” and are making driving easier and safer",0
"Much future progress in car computing will depend on creating integrated networking between vehicles and the road.  An advanced navigation system could take advantage of real-time information being transmitted by the surrounding vehicles.  For example, a stalled car would transmit warning messages to other drivers about the impending obstacle.  Vehicles that sense an oil slick, ice, or other road hazard could also “mark” the location so it can be avoided by subsequent drivers.  Data about the speed and spacing of traffic could provide real-time information about traffic jams, possibly routing vehicles into alternative lanes or other roads to reduce congestion and travel time ",0
"Smart cars are vehicles equipped with advanced computing and communication technologies that enable them to collect, analyze, and share data to provide a wide range of features and services.  These technologies include:Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS): Smart cars are equipped with a variety of sensors and cameras that enable ADAS features such as lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind spot monitoring.  These features use computer algorithms to analyze data from the sensors and provide alerts or take action to prevent accidents. Connectivity: Smart cars are connected to the internet and other vehicles, enabling them to share data about traffic conditions, road hazards, and weather conditions.  This connectivity also allows for over-the-air software updates, remote diagnostics, and other services. Infotainment: Smart cars offer advanced infotainment systems that provide features such as internet connectivity, voice commands, music streaming, and navigation.  These systems are often integrated with the vehicle's ADAS features to provide real-time information and alerts. Self-driving: Some smart cars are capable of autonomous driving, using a combination of sensors, cameras, and computer algorithms to navigate roads without human intervention.  These cars are still in development and are not yet widely available. Energy Efficiency: Smart cars often use advanced technologies such as regenerative braking, stop-start systems, and aerodynamic designs to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. ",0
"During the late 1950s and 1960s, software rapidly grew more complex—especially operating system software and large business applications.  With the typical program consisting of many components being developed by different programmers, it became difficult both to see the “big picture” and to maintain consistent procedures for transferring data from one program module to another.  As computer scientists worked to develop sounder principles , it also occurred to them that the power of the computer to automate procedures could be used to create tools for facilitating program design and managing the resulting complexity.  CASE, or computer-aided software engineering, is a catchall phrase that covers a variety of such tools involved with all phases of development",0
"The earliest design tool was the flowchart, often drawn with the aid of a template that could be used to trace the symbols on paper ,.  With its symbols for the flow of execution through branching and looping, the flowchart provides a good tool for visualizing how a program is intended to work.  However large and complex programs often result in a sea of flowcharts that are hard to relate to one another and to the program as a whole.  Starting in the 1960s, the creation of programs for manipulating flow symbols made it easier both to design flowcharts and to visualize them in varying levels of detail. ",0
"Once a program has been designed and implementation is under way, CASE tools can help the programmers maintain consistency across their various modules.  One such tool (now rather venerable) is the data dictionary, which is a database whose records contain information about the definition of data items and a list of program components that use each item ,.  When the definition of a data item is changed, the data dictionary can provide a list of affected components.  Database technology is also applied to software design in the creation of a database of objects within a particular program, which can be used to provide more extensive information during debugging.

"Analysis tools are computer software or web applications that are used to analyze data, identify patterns, and draw insights from large and complex datasets.  These tools are used by analysts, researchers, and data scientists to process and interpret data, in order to make informed decisions and predictions. Some popular analysis tools include:Statistical analysis software: These tools are used to perform statistical analysis on data, such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and clustering.  Examples include R, SAS, and SPSS. Data visualization software: These tools are used to create charts, graphs, and other visual representations of data, in order to help users understand and communicate data insights.

Examples include Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Cassandra. ",0
"In the late 1990s, a new consumer technology enabled users to create their own CDs with data or audio tracks.  The cheapest kind, CD-R (Compact Disk Recordable) uses a layer of a dyed material and a thin gold layer to reflect the laser beam.  Data is recorded by a laser beam hitting the dye layer in precise locations and marking it (in one of several ways, depending on technology).  The lengths of marked (“striped”) track and unmarked track together encode the data. ",0
"The DVD (alternatively, Digital Video Disc or Digital Versatile Disc) is similar to a CD, but uses laser light with a shorter wavelength.  This means that the size of the pits and lands will be considerably smaller, which in turns means that much more data can be stored on the same size disk.  A DVD disk typically stores up to 4. 7 GB of data, equivalent to about six CDs.  This capacity can be doubled by using both sides of the disk. The high capacity of DVD-ROMs (and their recordable equivalent, DVD-RAMs) makes them useful for storing feature-length movies or videos, very large games and multimedia programs, or large illustrated encyclopedias.  The development of high-definition television (HDTV) standards spurred the introduction of higher capacity DVD formats.  The competition between Sony’s Blu-Ray and HD-DVD (backed by Toshiba and Microsoft, among others) was resolved by 2008 in favor of the former.  BluRay offers high capacity (25GB for single layer discs, 50GB for dual layer). ",0
"Cellular automata theory has been applied to a variety of fields that deal with the complex interrelationships of components, including biology (microbe growth and population dynamics in general), ecology (including forestry), and animal behavior, such as the flight of birds.  (The cues that a bird identifies in its neighbors are like the input conditions for a cell in a cellular automaton.  The “output” would be the bird’s flight behavior. )The ability of cellular automatons to generate a rich complexity from simple components and rules mimics the development of life from simple components, and thus cellular automation is an important tool in the creation and study of artificial life.  This can be furthered by combining a set of cellular automation rules with a geneticalgorithm, including a mechanism for inheritance of characteristics.  Cellular automation principles can also be applied to engineering in areas such as pattern or image recognition",0
"Governments have always to varying degrees concerned themselves with the content of public media.  The growing use of the Internet for expressive activities , has prompted authoritarian governments such as that of China to attempt to block “objectionable” material both through filtering techniques , and through pressure on service providers.  Further, users identified as creators of banned content may be subjected to prosecution.  However because of the Internet’s decentralized structure and the ability of users to operate relatively anonymously, Internet censorship tends to be only partially effective ,. In the democratic West, Internet censorship generally applies to only a few forms of content.  Attempts to criminalize the online provision of pornography to minors in the 1996 Communications Decency Act have generally been overturned by the courts as excessively infringing on the right of adults to access such content.  However, a succession of bills seeking to require schools and libraries to install Web-filtering software culminated in the Children’s Internet Protection Act, which was upheld by the U. S.  Supreme Court in 2003. ",0
"By itself, a Web page coded in HTML is simply a “static” display that does not interact with the user (other than for the selection of links).  (See html, dhtml, and xhtm. ) Many Web services, including online databases and e-commerce transactions, require that the user be able to interact with the server.  For example, an online shopper may need to browse or search a catalog of CD titles, select one or more for purchase, and then complete the transaction by providing credit card and other information.  These functions are provided by “gateway programs” on the server that can access databases or other facilities. One way to provide interaction with (and through) a Web page is to use the CGI (common gateway interface).  CGI is a facility that allows Web browsers and other client programs to link to and run programs stored on a Web site.  The stored programs, called scripts, can be written in various languages such as JavaScript or PHP , and placed in a cgi-bin folder on the Web server. The CGI script is referenced by an HTML hyperlink on the Web page, such as<A HREF=“http://www. MyServer. com/cgi-bin/MyScript”>MyScript </A>",0
"While the attention of the first computer designers focused mainly on numeric calculations, it was clear that much of the data that business people and others would want to manipulate with the new machines would be textual in nature.  Billing records, for example, would have to include customer names and addresses, not just balance totals. The “natural” representation of data in a computer is as a series of two-state (binary) values, interpreted as binary numbers.  The solution for representing text (letters of the alphabet, punctuation marks, and other special symbols) is to assign a numeric value to each text symbol.  The result is a character code, such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which is the scheme used most widely today.  (Another system, EBCDIC (Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code) was used during the heyday of IBM mainframes, but is seldom used today. ",0
"Sophisticated string processing (such as parsing and pattern matching) tends to be awkward to express in traditional number-oriented programming languages.  Several languages have been designed especially for manipulating textual data.  Snobol, designed in the early 1960s, is best 82? ? ? ? characters and stringsknown for its sophisticated pattern-matching and pattern processing capabilities.  A similar language, Icon, is widely used for specialized string-processing tasks today.  Many programmers working with textual data in the UNIX environment have found that the awk and Perl languages are easier to use than C for extracting and manipulating data fields.  (See awk and Perl. )",0
"Many PC users have become acquainted with chatting through participating in “chat rooms” operated by online services such as America Online (AOL).  A chat room is a “virtual space” in which people meet either to socialize generally or to discuss particular topics.  At their best, chat rooms can develop into true communities whose participants develop long-term friendships and provide one another with information and emotional support ,. However, the essentially anonymous character of chat (where participants often use “handles” rather than real names) that facilitates freedom of expression can also provide a cover for mischief or even crime.  Chat rooms have acquired a rather lurid reputation in the eyes of the general public.  There has been considerable public concern about children becoming involved in inappropriate sexual conversation.  This has been fueled by media stories (sometimes exaggerated) about children being recruited into face-toface meetings with pedophiles.  AOL and other online services have tried to reduce such activity by restricting online sex chat to adults, but there is no reliable mechanism for a service to verify its user’s age.  A chat room can also be supervised by a host or moderator who tries to prevent “flaming” (insults) or other behavior that the online service considers to be inappropriate",0
"For people who find commercial online services to be too expensive or confining, there are alternatives available for just the cost of an Internet connection.  The popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was developed in Finland by Jarkko Oikarinen in the late 1980s.  Using one of the freely available client programs, users connect to an IRC server, which in turn is connected to one of dozens of IRC networks.  Users can create their own chat rooms (called channels).  There are thousands of IRC channels with participants all over the world.  To participate, a user simply joins a channel and sees all messages currently being posted by other users of the channel.  In turn, the user’s messages are posted for all to see.  While IRC uses only text, there are now enhanced chat systems (often written in Java to work with a Web browser) that add graphics and other features. There are many other technologies that can be used for conversing via the Internet.  Some chat services (such as Cu-SeeMe) enable participants to transmit their images ,.  Voice can also be transmitted over an Internet connection ,.  For a very pervasive form of “ad hoc” textual communication, see texting and instant messaging",0
"The famous Turing test , proposes that if a human is unable to reliably distinguish messages from a computer from those of another person, the computer program involved can at least be provisionally declared to be “intelligent. ” The advent of textual communication via the Internet , has afforded a variety of ways to attempt to meet this challenge.  Programs that mimic human conversational styles have come to be known as “chatterbots. ”The prototypical chatterbot was ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s ,.  ELIZA mimicked a form of nondirective psychotherapy in which the therapist echoes or plays off of the client’s statements as a form of gentle encouragement and validation.  Thus if one types, “My father didn’t really like me,” ELIZA might reply, “Tell me more about your father. ” Although primitive, ELIZA once inadvertently fooled an executive into thinking he was exchanging messages with Weizenbaum.  Other classic chatterbots include Parry, designed to mimic a paranoid, and the story-generating Racter. ",0
"With simple rules but endless permutations, chess has fascinated millions of players for hundreds of years.  When mechanical automatons became fashionable in the 18th century, onlookers were intrigued by “the Turk,” a chessplaying automaton.  While the Turk was eventually shown to be a hoax (a human player was hidden inside), the development of the electronic digital computer in the mid-20th century provided the opportunity to create a true automatic chess player. In 1950 Claude Shannon outlined the two basic strategies that would be used by future chess-playing programs.  The “brute force” strategy would examine the possible moves for the computer chess player, the possible replies of the opponent to each move, the possible next moves by the computer, and so on for as many half moves or “plies” as possible.  The moves would be evaluated by a “minimax” algorithm that would find the move that best improves the computer’s position despite the opponent’s best play. ",0
"The earliest computer chess theorists such as Claude Shannon and Alan Turing saw the game as one potential way to demonstrate true machine intelligence.  Ironically, by the time computers had truly mastered chess, the artificial intelligence (AI) community had concluded that mastering the game was largely irrelevant to their goals.  AI pioneers Herbert Simon and John McCarthy have referred to chess as “the Drosophila of AI. ” By this they mean that, like the ubiquitous fruit flies in genetics research, chess became an easy way to measure computer prowess.  But what was it measuring? The dominant brute-force approach was more a measure of computing power than the application of such AI techniques as pattern recognition.  (There is, however, still some interest in writing chess programs that “think” more like a human player. ) In recent years there has been some interest in programming computers to play the Asian board game Go, where positional and structural elements play a greater role than in chess.  However, even the latest generation of Go programs seem to be relying more on a statistical approach than a deep conceptual analysis. ",0
"In personal computers a chipset is a group of integrated circuits that together perform a particular function.  System purchasers generally think in terms of the processor itself (such as a Pentium III, Pentium IV, or competitive chips from AMD or Cyrix).  However they are really buying a system chipset that includes the microprocessor itself , and often a memory cache (which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip—see cache) as well as the chips that control the memory bus (which connects the processor to the main memory on the motherboard—see bus. ) The overall performance of the system depends not just on the processor’s architecture (including data width, instruction set, and use of instruction pipelines) but also on the type and size of the cache memory, the memory bus (RDRAM or “Rambus” and SDRAM) and the speed with which the processor can move data to and from memory. In addition to the system chipset, other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics (the AGP, or Advanced Graphics Port, for example), drive connection (EIDE controller), communication with external devices ,, and connections to expansion cards (the PCI bus).

"In the telecommunications industry, “the last mile” refers to the connections and equipment that actually bring content to users’ homes and businesses.  One source of Cisco’s continued growth in the 2000 decade is the way it has addressed the consumer sector through strategic acquisitions.  In 2003, Cisco acquired Linksys, maker of home Internet routers and wireless access points.  In 2005, Scientific Atlanta—maker of cable modems, digital cable boxes, and other consumer equipment—also became a Cisco company. The company has also entered the area of Internet telephony , by teaming up with Skype to build a cordless phone that can connect to a computer to make phone calls over the Internet. Moving from hardware into software, Cisco in 2007 purchased Utah Street Networks, a San Francisco–based maker of software to link online communities , and operator of the Tribe. net Web site.  Around the same time, Cisco made a much larger buy, acquiring WebEx, maker of online collaboration software, for $3. 2 billion. In 2007 Cisco had revenue of $35 billion, with more than 63,000 employees. ",0
"A class is a data type that combines both a data structure and methods for manipulating the data.  For example, a string class might consist of an array to hold the characters in the string and methods to compare strings, combine strings, or extract portions of a string ,. As with other data types, once a class is declared, objects (sometimes called instances) of the class can be created and used.  This way of structuring programs is called object-oriented programming because the class object is the basic building block ,. Object-oriented programming and classes provide several advantages over traditional block-structured languages.  In a traditional BASIC or even Pascal program, there is no particular connection between the data structure and the procedures or functions that manipulate it.  In a large program one programmer might change the data structure without alerting other programmers whose code assumes the original structure.  On the other hand, someone might write a procedure that directly manipulates the internal data rather than using the methods already provided.  Either transgression can lead to hard-to-find bugs. ",0
"It is often more efficient to have a large, relatively expensive computer provide an application or service to users on many smaller, inexpensive computers that are linked to it by a network connection.  The term server can apply to both the application providing the service and the machine running it.  The program or machine that receives the service is called the client. A familiar example is browsing the Web.  The user runs a Web browser, which is a client program.  The browser connects to the Web server that hosts the desired Web site.  Another example is a corporate server that runs a database.  Users’ client programs connect to the database over a local area network (LAN).  Many retail transactions are also handled using a client-server arrangement.  Thus, when a travel or theater booking agent sells a ticket, the agent’s client program running on a PC or terminal connects to the server containing the database that keeps track of what seats are available",0
"There are several advantages to using the client-server model.  Having most of the processing done by one or more servers means that these powerful and more costly machines can be used to the greatest efficiency.  If more processing capacity is needed, more servers can be brought online without having to revamp the whole system.  Users, on the other hand, only need PCs (or terminals) that are powerful enough to run the smaller client program to connect to the server. Keeping the data in a central location helps ensure its integrity: If a database is on a server, transactions can be committed in an orderly way to ensure that, for example, the same ticket isn’t sold to two people.  A client-server model also offers flexibility to users.  Any client program that meets the standards supported by the server can be used to make a connection. ",0
"The transfer of data within the microprocessor and between the microprocessor and memory must be synchronized to ensure that the data needed to execute each instruction is available when the flow of execution has reached an appropriate point.  This synchronization is accomplished by moving data in intervals that correspond to the pulses of the system clock (a quartz crystal).  This is done by sending control signals that tell the components of the processor and memory when to send or wait for data.  Thus, if the microprocessor is the heart of the computer, the clock is the heart’s pacemaker.  Because most devices cannot run at the same pace as the processor, circuits in various parts of the motherboard create secondary control signals that run at various ratios of the actual system clock speed.

"Common Business-Oriented Language was developed under the impetus of a 1959 Department of Defense initiative to create a common language for developing business applications that centered on the processing of data from files.  (The military, after all, was a “business” whose inventory control and accounting needs dwarfed those of all but the largest corporations. ) At the time, the principal business-oriented language for mainframe computers was FLOW-MATIC, a language developed by Grace Hopper’s team at RemingtonRand UNIVAC and limited to that company’s computers ,.  The first COBOL compilers became available in 1960, and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) issued a standard specification for the language in 1968.  Expanded standards were issued in 1974 and 1985 (COBOL-74 and COBOL-85) with a new standard issued in 2002. ",0
"Short for “coder/decoder,” a codec is essentially an algorithm for encoding (and compressing) a stream of data for transmission, and then decoding and decompressing it at the receiving end.  Usually the data involved represents audio or video content ,.  Typically the data is being downloaded from a Web site to be played on a personal computer or portable player ,. A codec is described as “lossy” if some of the original information is lost in the compression process.  It then becomes a question of whether the loss in quality is perceived by the user as significant.  A codec that preserves all the information needed to re-create the original file is “lossless. ” For most purposes, the much greater size of the lossless version of a file is not worth the (often imperceptible) increase in quality or fidelity. A codec is usually used in connection with a “container format” that specifies how the encoded data is to be stored in a file.  Often a container can hold more than one data stream and even more than one kind of media (such as video and audio).  When one refers to a Windows WAV file, for example, one is actually referring to a container. ",0
"Cognitive science is the study of mental processes such as reasoning, memory, and the processing of perception.  It is necessarily an interdisciplinary approach that includes fields such as psychology, linguistics, and neurology.  The importance of the computer to cognitive science is that it offers a potential nonhuman model for a thinking entity.  The attempts at artificial intelligence over the past 50 years have used the insights of cognitive science to help devise artificial means of reasoning and perception.  At the same time, the models created by computer scientists (such as the neural network and Marvin Minsky’s idea of “multiple intelligent agents”) have in turn been applied to the study of human cognition ,",0
"With the exception of a few experimental systems, color graphics first became widely available only with the beginnings of desktop computers in the late 1970s.  The first microcomputers were able to display only a few colors (some, indeed, displayed only monochrome or grayscale).  Today’s PC video hardware has the potential to display millions of colors, though of course the human eye cannot directly distinguish colors that are too close together.  There are several important schemes that are used to define a “color space”—that is, a range of values that can be associated with physical colors. ",0
"One of the simplest color systems displays colors as varying intensities of red, green, and blue.  This corresponds to the electronics of a standard color computer monitor, which uses three electron guns that bombard red, green, and blue phosphors on the screen.  A typical RGB color scheme uses 8 bits to store each of the red, green, and blue components for each pixel, for a total of 24 bits (16,777,216 colors).  The 32-bit color system provides the same number of colors but includes 8 bits for alpha, or the level of transparency.  The number of bits per pixel is also called the bit depth or color depth",0
"CMYK stands for cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.  This four component color system is standard for most types of color printing, since black is an ink color in printing but is simply the absence of color in video.  One of the more difficult tasks to be performed by desktop publishing software is to properly match a given RGB screen color to the corresponding CMYK print color.  Recent versions of Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh operating system include a CMS (color matching system) to support color matching. ",0
"Although most color schemes now support thousands or millions of colors, it would be wasteful and inefficient to use three or four bytes to store the color of each pixel in memory.  After all, any given application is likely to need only a few dozen colors.  The solution is to set up a palette,which is a table of (usually 256) color values currently in use by the program.  (A palette is also sometimes called a CLUT, or color lookup table. ) The color of each pixel can then be stored as an index to the corresponding value in the palette",0
"Portability is the ability to adapt software or hardware to a wide variety of platforms (that is, computer systems or operating systems).  Developers want their products to be portable so they can adapt to an often rapidly changing marketplace.  A typical strategy for portability is to choose a language that is in widespread use and a compiler that is certified as meeting the ANSI or other standard for the language.  The program should be written in such a way that it makes as few assumptions as possible about hardwaredependent matters such as how data is stored in memory.  It is also sometimes possible to use standard frameworks that provide the same functions in several different operating systems such as Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX. ",0
"A compiler is a program that takes as input a program written in a source language and produces as output an equivalent program written in another (target) language.  Usually the input program is in a high-level language such as C++ and the output is in assembly language for the target machine ,. Compilers are useful because programming directly in low-level machine instructions (as had to be done with the first computers) is tedious and prone to errors.  Use of assembly language helps somewhat by allowing substitution of symbols (variable names) for memory locations and the use of mnemonic names for operations (such as “add for addition, rather than some binary instruction code).  An assembler is essentially a compiler that needs to make only relatively simple translations, because assembly language is still at a relatively low level. ",0
"Compilers are traditionally thought of as having a “front end” that analyzes the source code (high-level language statements) and a “back end” that generates the appropriate low-level code.  The front end processing begins with lexical analysis.  The compiler scans the source program looking for matches to valid tokens as defined by the language.  A token is any word or symbol that has meaning in the language, such as a keyword (reserved word) such as if or while.  Next, the tokens are parsed or grouped according to the rules of the language.  The result of parsing is a “parse tree” that resolves statements into their component parts.  For example, an assignment statement may be parsed into an identifier, an assignment operator (such as =), and a value to be assigned.  The value in turn may be an arithmetic expression that consists of operators and operands. ",0
"The process of code generation usually involves multiple passes that gradually substitute machine-specific code and data for the information in the parse tree.  An important consideration in modern compilers is optimization, which is the process of substituting equivalent (but more efficient) constructs for the original output of the front end.  For example, an optimizer can replace an arithmetic expression with its value so that it need not be repeatedly calculated while the program is running.  It can also “hoist out” an invariant expression from a loop so that it is calculated only once before the loop begins.  On a larger scale, optimization can also improve the communication between different parts (procedures) of the program. The compiler must attempt to “prove” that the change it is making in the program will never cause the program to operate incorrectly.  It can do this, for example, by tracing the possible paths of execution through the program (such as through branching and loops) and verifying that each possible path yields the correct result.  A compiler that is too “aggressive” in making assumptions can produce subtle program errors.  (Many compilers allow the user to control the level of optimization, and whether to optimize for speed or for compactness of program size. ) During development, a compiler is often set to include special debugging code in the output.  This code preserves potentially important information that can help the debugging facility better identify program bugs.  After the program is working correctly, it will be recompiled without the debugging code",0
